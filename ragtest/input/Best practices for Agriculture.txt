1.Building Agricultural Resilience in Flood-Prone Areas	
for Purbi Champaran	

The ICAR-Indian Institute of Water Management, in collaboration with other institutions, initiated a research study to enhance agriculture resilience in flood-prone areas of Bihar and Odisha. The study focuses on post-flood crop management and index-based flood insurance to develop flood-resilient agricultural practices and adaptation measures. By analyzing flood frequency and extent, the researchers identified severely affected areas and implemented post-flood crop management plans. These plans involved providing farmers with alternate crop seeds, promoting over-aged rice seedlings, and cultivating mango saplings for flood cushioning. The interventions resulted in improved net returns, increased grain yield, and enhanced benefit-cost ratios, contributing to agricultural resilience in flood-prone areas.

2.Sustainable Agriculture Revolution: Kedia Village's Journey to Organic Farming and Empowering Farmers	
For Jamui
Kedia village in Bihar faced agricultural challenges due to water scarcity and failed crops. A group of farmers decided to switch to organic farming with the help of an NGO. They educated other farmers about the benefits and gradually convinced them to adopt organic farming practices. They used cow dung, vermicompost, and bio-pesticides to improve soil health and reduce dependence on chemicals. After three years, they witnessed improved production and reduced input costs. The farmers also acquired a solar-powered cold storage facility to prevent wastage of their produce. The success of Kedia village inspired neighboring villages to replicate their methods, leading to overall positive impacts on livelihoods and sustainability.


3.Empowering Farmers through Agri-Venture: Indira Livelihood Development Centre
for Nalanda
Dedicated Goat Resource Centre that aimed to empower farmers in the field of goatry. The centre specialized in cattle health management, integrated farming practices incorporating fishery, and the development of goat farming techniques. Centre provided comprehensive training and consultancy support to farmers, equipping them with the necessary knowledge and skills to excel in goat farming. Although the venture initially faced challenges, it emerged as one of the leading resource centres in Bihar's goatry sector. The success and impact of Centre were widely recognized, with the centre receiving prestigious awards and commendations for its contributions to the agricultural sector and the empowerment of farmers. Through its innovative approaches and support services, the Agri-Venture: Indira Livelihood Development Centre played a vital role in promoting sustainable and profitable goat farming practices, improving the livelihoods of farmers, and contributing to the agricultural development of Bihar.

4.Dairy Farming as a Tool for Poverty Eradication and Women Empowerment
for Sheikhpura
A woman farmer overcame poverty and ensured proper nourishment for her family by establishing a mini dairy farm. Starting with a single cow , she gradually expanded her herd to 10 crossbred cows . Currently, she manages a well-functioning dairy farm with 12 cows, yielding an average of 90 liters of milk per day. She sells the milk locally and also produces 10 kg of Peda (a sweet) from unsold milk. 30 women starting their own cow rearing initiatives under her guidance. Additionally, 25 farmers have adopted vermicompost production following her example. Almoti serves as a role model for women in her locality, showcasing how starting a mini dairy can help alleviate hunger, poverty, and malnutrition.

5.Empowering Farmers through Diversified Vegetable Cultivation and Profitable Strawberry Farming
for Buxar
A farmer from Buxar successfully implemented year-round vegetable production, including potato, beans, capsicum, cowpea, and coriander, to tap into off-season markets. Additionally, he ventured into strawberry cultivation, which proved to be more profitable than his previous crops. Inspired by his success, neighboring farmers also started cultivating strawberries. He achieved a strawberry yield of 5 tonnes per acre and received good market prices. The intervention of the Buxar Krishi Vigyan Kendra played a crucial role in providing quality planting materials, storage, and marketing support. The cultivation of high-value crops like potato, beans, and cowpea generated higher returns due to increased demand from hotels and local markets. Strawberry cultivation not only proved to be profitable but also provided employment opportunities and attracted rural youths to smart farming.

6.Improved Technology For Sustainable Guinea Fowl Production Introduced
for Purbi Champaran
Two Agricultural Research Institutes developed an improved technology for sustainable Guinea Fowl production to address the issue of seasonality in reproduction. Through dietary interventions and photoperiod alteration, the institute successfully extended the laying period of Guinea Fowl, leading to increased egg production. The technology has been implemented by a farmer in Bihar, resulting in higher income and potential for revolutionizing Guinea Fowl production.

7.Blossoming Prosperity: The Inspiring Transformation of Barren Land into Mango Orchards
Banka
A highly qualified and innovative woman farmer successfully converted barren land into cultivable land by planting mango trees and using cow dung compost. With technical support and training from agricultural institutions, she reduced input costs and increased productivity, resulting in a significant increase in net profits. Her innovative cultivation techniques have been recognized, and she is now seen as a role model for other farmers in the district.

8.Training in Mushroom Cultivation and Spawn Production Leads to Sustainable Livelihoods for Women Farmers
Banka
A woman farmer received training from KVK Banka on mushroom cultivation and spawn production. She then adopted various innovative methods such as growing mushrooms on sugarcane leaves, maize, and paddy seed waste. She produces mushrooms year-round, including different species, and also provides mushroom spawn to nearby farmers. Her dedication and knowledge-sharing have motivated around 300 women farmers in neighboring villages to engage in mushroom cultivation, improving their livelihoods. She aims to establish a well-equipped mushroom spawn lab and create a mushroom hub in her village, Jhirwa.

9.Revolutionizing Makhana Processing: An Institute Mechanized System Enhances Livelihoods and Market Value
Darbhanga
An Institute of Post-Harvest Engineering and Technology (CIPHET) has developed a mechanized system for Makhana popping, which includes processes like threshing, cleaning, grading, drying, roasting, and popping. This technology has improved the working conditions for farmers in Darbhanga and produced higher quality Makhana for domestic and export markets. The mechanized process reduces processing time and results in better market value for the product. The machine is being commercially manufactured and has garnered interest from entrepreneurs in different regions of India. The government has provided subsidies, and the technology has received recognition for its societal impact. The mechanization of the Makhana popping process is expected to increase cultivation area, and production, and improve the livelihoods of communities involved in Makhana cultivation.

10.Reviving Makhana Cultivation in Darbhanga through Farmers Training and FPO Support
Darbhanga
Bihar is a major producer of Makhana in India, but the cultivation area has declined. Darbhanga is a prominent district for Makhana production, involving numerous families. Training programs have been conducted by various organizations to improve cultivation, processing, and marketing. NABARD has supported the formation of Farmer's Producer Organizations (FPOs) and provided financial assistance. Additionally, training has been given to fishermen, FPOs, producer groups, and enterprises. These efforts have resulted in employment opportunities and improved cultivation techniques.
