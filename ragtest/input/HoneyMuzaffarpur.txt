Rating Outlook
M-CRIL’s viewpoint (positive, neutral or negative) of the future prospects of the organisation

The honey value chain initiative of EDA was undertaken in the Muzaffarpur region of Bihar, India – one of the poorest sub-regions of the world. The project context includes an environment of extensive feudalism and social fragmentation. The project employed a strategy of facilitating BDS markets to promote technical services, linkages, and promoting choice in marketing while strictly minimizing direct grants. The six-year project (2002-8) supported by the Ford Foundation built upon a three-year credit facilitation activity undertaken by EDA with a limited fee-for-service provision made by the Small Industries Development Bank of India.
The EDA project has resulted in substantial productivity gains for producers of honey and a significant increase in the price realized by them, leading to a phenomenal increase in the number of producers. This was achieved through the introduction of technical services to enhance productivity, facilitation of market competition amongst buyers, the promotion of producers’ associations for collective selling, and policy advocacy with the complementary development of linkages. The variable strength of the emerging producers’ associations is symptomatic of the fragmented and feudal social structure of the region. It would take a substantial additional effort by EDA to address this issue and cement the collective action enabled by these institutions. Their potential has, nevertheless, been demonstrated. The patchy approach of the banks to providing credit support also needs to be addressed.

Rating Rationale
Dimension Details:
Status of VC Project:
VC Location – Project Area: Muzaffarpur + 2 adjoining districts of Bihar, India
Years of Operation: 3 (credit only) + 6
Legal Status of VC Facilitator: Private limited company
Financed by: Ford Foundation
Support from Government: Negligible
Current Status of Programme: Self-managed
Economic Context:
Area Population (3 districts): 10 million
Income per Capita, Bihar: Rs 10,570 ($264)
Income per Capita, India: Rs 33,283 ($832)
Rural Households Below National Poverty Line (2006): 28% (India 18%)
Agricultural Land Distribution: 78% holdings <1 hectare
Agriculture/State GDP: 40%
Rural Adult Literacy – Male: 58% (India 71%)
Rural Adult Literacy – Female: 30% (India 47%)
Key VC Initiatives:
Facilitate Bank Linkage: Loan application and repayments
Market Support: Start independent marketing agents, contacts with corporate agents, alliance with dairy federation to market honey
Productivity & Quality Improvements: Training (government linkage) – basic beekeeping, extraction of byproducts
Formation & Capacity Building of Community Institutions: Formation of associations/state level federation, collective marketing, training in business skills
Promotion of Other Linkages: Establish honey processing plants, testing facility; production of beehive boxes, foundation sheets, small equipment
Advocacy: Lobbying to reduce tax, publication of directory, workshops for banks to increase the flow of credit to beekeepers and VC links
Target Population: Marginal and small farmer households; backward castes (beekeeping)
Contribution to Poverty Reduction: More households engaged in honey production, higher earnings, more hired wage employment (male), more employment in linked activities, reduced outmigration.
Project Context: Bihar is the second poorest state in India, with the lowest per capita income ($264) where 28% of rural households live below the national poverty line (18% all India, rural).
Project Management: The VC project has been managed by a team of 3-5 professionals under the aegis of a for-profit social enterprise. EDA continues to facilitate the VC (albeit at a reduced level) even after the project closed in June 2008.
Strategy: Range of activities at all levels of the VC. Strategy of minimizing grant support to producers and BDS providers. Benefits continue post-project.
Project Outputs: Significant increase in productivity from 30kg to over 40kg per hive, even in a year of moderate productivity, and a substantial increase in the number of producers from around 1,800 to over 9,000.
Linkages: Both upstream and downstream linkages have been significantly enhanced. These include increased numbers of bee box suppliers, foundation sheet makers, brood suppliers, and a better flow of credit to producers, on the one hand, and increased activity of market agents as honey buyers, on the other.
Marketing: Competition between buyers of corporate branded honey marketers as well as individual market agents (and the advent of a large marketing cooperative) has greatly enhanced choice for producers/sellers with the selling price of the product increasing from Rs 30-35 in 2002 to Rs 55-65 in 2008.
Producer Institutions: The organization of as many as 45 producer associations in Bihar represents a significant step forward for the VC project. The variable quality of these associations and the weakness of the beekeepers’ federation is the result of the fragmented and feudal nature of society in the region.
Contribution to Poverty Reduction: Sample estimates – 80% beekeeper households report an increase in income; 40% below ‘$1/day’ in 2002, reduced to 30% in 2008. (Non-beekeeper samples show a small increase in poverty from 38% to 44%). One-third hire one full-time employee for beekeeping. Another 7% hire seasonal labor. Wages at par with, or slightly above, local market conditions.
Cost-Effectiveness: A five-fold growth in producer numbers and a 12-fold increase in production, together with a 2.5 times increase in the price of honey, results in a very low project cost ($129) per beekeeper and a very high
