1. Preamble
The Government of Bihar (GOB) aims to achieve 17% green cover in the state by providing a supply-side push to the afforestation program.

The government also aims to create a demand-side pull by promoting efficient and integrated wood-based industries, thereby providing competitive prices to farmers and encouraging them to grow more trees on their farmland.
Bihar’s wood-based industries include licensed sawmills (2,272), veneer mills (142), plywood industries, and several furniture-making units spread across the 38 districts (mostly in the unorganized sector).
