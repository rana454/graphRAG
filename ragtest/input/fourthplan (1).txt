Fourth Agriculture Roadmap
2023-28
1. Background
Bihar is an agrarian state, endowed with fertile land and hardworking farmers. Therefore, Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalam, the former President of India, called the agriculture sector the core competence of Bihar. Accelerated development of the agriculture sector in eastern states, especially Bihar, is crucial for the food security of the country, as highlighted by the National Commission on Farmers.
Current Status of Agriculture
The current status of agriculture in the state can be understood based on land utilization statistics. According to the land utilization statistics for 2020-21:
* Geographical Area: 9359.57 lakh hectares
* Forest Area: 621.64 lakh hectares
* Barren and Uncultivable Land: 431.72 lakh hectares
* Non-Agricultural Land: 1750.74 lakh hectares
* Agricultural Wasteland: 43.79 lakh hectares
* Non-Agricultural Land (Other than Fallow): 264.76 lakh hectares
* Fallow Land:
   * Current Fallow: 1028.10 lakh hectares
   * Other Fallow: 173.50 lakh hectares
* Net Cropped Area: 50.45 lakh hectares
* Gross Cropped Area: 72.46 lakh hectares
* Cropping Intensity (%): 144%
According to the Agriculture Census (2015-16), out of the total number of land holdings in the state, 91.21 percent are marginal holdings, with a holding size of less than 1 hectare.
The agriculture sector significantly contributes to the state's economy. According to the Bihar Economic Survey 2021-22, the contribution of the agriculture sector to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the state in 2020-21 was about 19 percent. Within the agriculture sector:
* Crop Contribution: 9.3 percent
* Livestock Contribution: 6.6 percent
* Fisheries Contribution: 1.7 percent
The contribution of the agriculture sector at fixed prices in 2016-17 was Rs. 66,668 crore (21.7 percent of GDP), which increased to Rs. 74,086 crore in 2020-21 (19 percent of GDP). The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of agriculture sector's contribution to GSDP during 2016-17 to 2020-21 was 2.1 percent.
According to the 2019 NSS report, "Situation Assessment of Agricultural Households and Land and Livestock Holding of Households in Rural India," the average income of agricultural households in the state is Rs. 7,542, more than double compared to the year 2012-13. At the national level, the average income of agricultural households increased from Rs. 6,426 to Rs. 10,218 during the same period. Therefore, the rate of increase in income of agricultural households in Bihar has been higher than the national average.
As per the NSS report, 39.7 percent of agricultural households in Bihar are indebted, with a debt per agricultural household of Rs. 23,534, while at the national level, 50.2 percent of agricultural households are indebted, with a debt per agricultural household of Rs. 74,121.
Development Efforts and Achievements
For the optimal utilization of agricultural resources and the economic upliftment of farmers, the State Government has been consistently working on the development of the agriculture sector through the Agricultural Road Map since 2008. For the first time, "Farmer" was defined under the Agricultural Road Map for the sake of implementing schemes. According to this definition, "Farmers" includes landless agricultural laborers, sharecroppers, tenants, small, marginal, and sub-marginal cultivators, farmers with larger holdings, fishers, livestock and poultry rearers, pastoralists, small plantation farmers, as well as rural and tribal families engaged in various farming-related occupations such as apiculture, sericulture, and vermiculture. The term also includes tribal families sometimes engaged in shifting cultivation and the collection and use of non-timber forest products. Farm and Home Science graduates earning their livelihoods from crop and animal husbandry, fisheries, and agro-forestry are also considered part of the farming community. As a result, more than 1.90 crore farmers have been registered on the DBT portal of the Agriculture Department, including more than 68 lakh landless farmers.
The first three Agricultural Road Maps have been implemented by the state government with the resolve: "A dish of Bihar in the plate of every Indian" (Pratyek Bhartiya ke thal me Bihar ka ek vyanjan). Schemes were implemented for a qualitative increase in agricultural production and for strengthening and rejuvenating infrastructure to take agricultural produce from the state to the entire country.

Implementation
The Fourth Agriculture Road Map has been prepared after extensive discussions. Various priorities have been set for achieving the objectives of the Agriculture Road Map. Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) have been prepared for the priority areas. Along with the DPRs, ongoing projects which need to be implemented in the next five years also form part of this roadmap. Subject-wise DPRs and ongoing schemes are described in the subsequent chapters.
Agriculture — Crops & Horticulture
For the holistic development of agriculture and allied sectors, the main target of the Fourth Agriculture Road Map is to increase per hectare productivity of crops. To enhance productivity, the use of modern agriculture techniques, particularly digital technology, will be extensively utilized. This Road Map aims at reducing the cost of cultivation and increasing realization from agriculture to all farmers, especially small and marginal farmers. The agricultural development strategies will use sustainable development techniques that do not adversely affect environmental and human health. To develop the crop and horticulture sector in the state, the use of barren, uncultivable, and current fallow land would be prioritized. Crop diversification and crop intensification shall be the focus of this Road Map. In order to achieve the goals/objectives for the overall development of crop and horticulture sectors, major priority areas (DPR) along with the ongoing schemes have been identified for the Fourth Agriculture Road Map. These areas are:
1. Seed Development
2. Crop Diversification
3. Pulses and Oilseeds Mission
4. Plant Protection
5. Bihar Organic Farming Promotion Program
6. Agricultural Market System Reforms
7. Soil and Water Conservation Program
8. Agricultural Mechanization
9. Climate Resilient Agriculture Program
10. Horticulture Development
11. Use of Modern Technology in Agriculture
12. Agricultural Education
13. Agricultural Research
14. Agricultural Extension
15. Risk / Mitigation / Management
16. Soil, Seed, Fertilizer, Pesticide Testing Laboratory
17. Establishment of MEL Cell for Monitoring and Evaluation
Introduction
Seed is an important and indispensable component of agriculture. The efficacy of other agricultural inputs depends on the quality of seed. High yielding varieties' seeds have played an important role in the Green Revolution. Higher yield can be obtained by cultivating quality seeds. Various researches and studies confirm that 15-20 percent more yield can be obtained by using quality seeds and up to 45 percent more production can be obtained as a result of proper use of other inputs and timely cultivation activities. In order to ensure the supply of quality seeds to the farmers, the Agriculture Road Map has been implemented in the state since 2008.
Achievements of the Last Three Agricultural Road Maps
As a result of the action plans implemented under the Agricultural Road Map, there has been a significant improvement in the seed replacement rate. There has been a significant increase in the annual seed replacement rate of paddy, wheat, and maize crops. Under the Agriculture Road Map 2017-23, the target of seed replacement rate of paddy was kept at 50 percent, against which the average achievement of the last 5 years was 45.16 percent. Similarly, the average achievement for wheat, maize, pulses, and oilseeds was 39.10 percent, 94.39 percent, 16.14 percent, and 51.74 percent respectively, against the target of 35 percent, 90 percent, 30 percent, and 70 percent respectively. Therefore, it is evident that except for wheat and maize, the seed replacement rate for other crops, especially pulses and oilseeds, is low and it is important to increase seed production to promote the use of quality seeds in Bihar.
Various centrally sponsored schemes and state schemes such as Chief Minister Crash Seed Program, Integrated Seed Village Scheme, Mini-kit Seed Distribution, Certified Seed Production Program, Special Pulses and Oilseed Seed Distribution Program, and Sub Mission on Seeds and Planting Material were implemented during the Agriculture Road Map 2017-23 and a total of 34.15 lakh quintal seeds were distributed among the farmers. During Covid-19, the facility of home delivery was started by the department to provide seeds to the farmers at their doorstep. A total quantity of 2.50 lakh quintal of seeds have been distributed among farmers through home delivery under various schemes during the third road map period. Under various schemes, quality seeds are being provided to the farmers through an App developed by BRBN. Reports related to seed distribution and details of beneficiary farmers are obtained through the online App.

1.2 Crop Diversification and Intensification
Introduction:
The prevalent cropping system of the state is Rice-Wheat based. The productivity of the rice-wheat cropping system in the state is low for several reasons. This cropping system is majorly affected by Climate Change attributes. In accordance with the priority of the development of Agriculture in the state, there is a need for diversification in the cropping system. It is also important to develop the cropping system as per the needs of the market. Crop diversification is expected to increase the income of farmers. To promote diversification, schemes such as Climate Resilient Agriculture Program, Oilseeds and Pulses Promotion Program, and Horticulture Development Programs are currently implemented in the state.
Under DPR of Crop Diversification and Intensification, the following components will be implemented:
1. Millets Development Programme
2. Jute Development Programme

* To promote crop diversification, a Centre of Excellence (COE) for millets will be established at Gaya. The COE will facilitate:
   * Development of new varieties of millets as per the agro-climatic situation of the state.
   * Post-production marketing and value addition of millets as per market demands.
* Suitable seeds of jute and millets will be provided to the farmers to promote crop diversification.
* Cultivation of aromatic and medicinal plants (e.g., Lemongrass, Palma-rosa, Tulsi, Satawari) with micro-irrigation and distillation unit facilities will be promoted in the barren and uncultivated lands of South Bihar.
* Cultivation of dryland horticulture crops (e.g., Indian gooseberry (Amla), Wood apple, Jackfruits) will be promoted.
* Khus cultivation will be promoted in the Diara areas of Budhi Gandak and Kosi river of North Bihar.
Fourth Agriculture Roadmap 2023-28
Introduction:
Plant protection plays an important role in modern technology-based crop production. In India, about 30-35% of crops are lost every year due to pests and weeds. By strengthening plant protection and adopting measures to effectively control pests, diseases, and weeds, the percentage of crop damage caused by these factors can be reduced. The lack of modern spraying and dispersion equipment at plant protection centers has led to a decline in the plant protection services provided to farmers. There is a need to increase manpower at the Plant Protection Centers to rejuvenate these services. After the Green Revolution, the dependence of farmers on chemical pesticides has increased. Pesticides are not used in scientifically recommended doses by farmers, leading to adverse effects on the environment and human health.
Brief Achievements of the Last Three Agricultural Roadmaps:
Field schools based on the principle of learning by doing and seeing were organized in the farmers’ fields during Kharif and Rabi seasons. The theme of the farmers' training in these field schools was based on integrated pest management. There is a need to increase the number of farmers' field schools.
Priorities for Plant Protection:
1. Operationalization of Plant Protection Centers at Block Level in PPP Mode
   * The identified service provider agency shall arrange necessary spraying equipment, such as rocker sprayers, knapsack sprayers, duster cum sprayers, power sprayers, multiboom sprayers, and STP power sprayer/dusters, along with adequate security equipment for spraying at plant protection centers and skilled personnel for spraying.
   * Payment received by the service agency from the farmers will be shared between the service agency and the government in a proportion of 80:20 respectively.
   * Currently, only 338 Plant Protection Centers are located in E-Kisan Bhawan. In the remaining blocks, 196 Plant Protection Centers will be set up in the next 5 years.
   * Stationary materials and furniture will be provided to Plant Protection Centers in 534 blocks in a phased manner over the next 5 years for operationalization of these centers in PPP mode. Provision has been made for recurring expenditure on this component.
2. Encouragement to Private Entrepreneurs for Setting Up Biopesticide Production Units
   * In Bihar, bio-agents/biopesticides are produced in negligible quantities, leading to reliance on externally produced biopesticides. This affects the availability of quality inputs to farmers.
   * Ten biopesticide production units will be set up by private entrepreneurs in a phased manner over the next five years for the supply of Trichoderma and Trichograma cards. Land for these units will be arranged by the entrepreneurs themselves, with 20% of the total cost borne by the entrepreneur and 80% as a subsidy from the department. Provision has been made for recurring expenditure every year.
3. Use of Unmanned Vehicles (Drones) for Plant Protection
   * A service provider agency will be identified for the operation of unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) across all 38 districts.
   * 5,70,000 acres of land will be covered under this initiative in the next 5 years. Spraying services will be made available to farmers through drone technology, with government assistance at the rate of Rs. 250 per acre. Provision has been made for recurring expenditure every year.
4. Plant Protection Advisory & Input Distribution
   * Plant Protection School: Plant protection schools will be organized on the fields of progressive farmers to propagate the latest techniques in agriculture. Information related to field preparation, crop management, and pest/disease/weed control will be provided by plant protection workers, agricultural experts, and extension workers. This school will follow the principle of learning by doing and seeing.
   * Demonstration of Biological Components of Plant Protection in Farmers' Fields: Live demonstrations of biological components of plant protection will be conducted at farmers' fields to encourage the use of bio-agents and biopesticides. This will promote organic farming and enhance export quality and market prices for major crops such as mango, litchi, makhana, and basmati rice. Provision has been made for recurring expenditure every year.
   * Capacity Building of Extension Personnel: Agricultural personnel will be trained in the latest plant protection techniques by Plant Protection Centers, augmenting the capacity of the Agriculture Department’s personnel.
   * Capacity Building of Pesticide Dealers: Pesticide dealers, who are often the first point of contact for farmers, will receive training to increase their capacity. Training programs will be organized in batches of 25 dealers per district.
   * Providing Organic/Chemical Inputs to Farmers at Subsidized Rates: To promote integrated pest and disease management, inputs will be provided at subsidized rates under plant protection schemes. This includes organic/chemical inputs, pheromone traps, sticky traps, etc. Provision has been made for recurring expenditure every year.
   * Analysis for Quality of Pesticides and Biological Pesticides: Currently, there is no testing system for biopesticides in Bihar, leading to samples being sent outside the state for testing, which incurs high costs and delays. The current testing facility can only handle 87 samples.
Quality Control of Pesticides
Analysis of Pesticides in the State:
Quality Control Laboratory, Mithapur, and Patna handle the analysis of pesticides in the state. As of October 1, 2022, there are 318 insecticides registered under Section 9(3) of the Insecticides Act, 1968. Due to inadequate testing facilities, not all pesticide samples sold in the state are being taken and tested. Adequate financial outlay has been provided for testing all kinds of pesticides. To ensure the quality of pesticides, samples for testing will be sent to:
* Quality Control Laboratory, Mithapur, Patna
* Indian Agricultural Research Institute affiliated institute
* National Institute of Plant Health Management (NIPHM), Hyderabad
* Bihar Agricultural University Sabour, Bhagalpur
* Dr. Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University, Pusa, Samastipur
* Other identified Bio-Products Testing Laboratories
Modernization and Renovation of Plant Protection Office:
* Necessary furniture, accounting materials, computers, and computer operators on a contract basis will be provided to:
   * Joint Director, Plant Protection
   * Divisional Deputy Director, Plant Protection
   * Assistant Director posted in the district
* Vehicles on a monthly hire basis will be ensured.
* A provision has been made for recurring expenditure on this every year.
Exposure Visit / Training:
* Officials of Plant Protection will be trained at the National Institute of Plant Health Management (NIPHM), Hyderabad, and other training institutes for knowledge enhancement and capacity building.
* Through exposure visits, Plant Protection officials will learn about advanced technology-based crop protection programs adopted in other states, enhancing their knowledge.
Bihar Organic Promotion Program
Introduction:
Injudicious and incessant use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides has adversely affected human health and the environment. Around 30 percent of food produced worldwide gets wasted. Approximately 1 million species are threatened with extinction. Unsustainable agriculture attributes to biodiversity loss, contributing to global warming, contaminating soil, and threatening rural livelihoods as well as food and nutrition security. The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report showed that our food systems are estimated to cause up to 29% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.
One of the major causes of Nitrous Oxide emission is crop production and the use of chemicals in daily life. Due to various schemes of the Govt. of Bihar, such as the construction of vermicompost units, green manuring, and training and capacity building of farmers, there has been an inclination towards the adoption of Organic Farming among farmers, leading to emerging markets for organic produce.
Achievements of Last Three Agricultural Roadmaps:
In the last three agricultural roadmaps, various government schemes for the promotion of organic farming have been successfully implemented. The major achievements include:
* Construction of 786,604 Pucca Vermi Units

1.6 Development of Agriculture Marketing in Bihar
Introduction
The agricultural sector in Bihar makes a significant contribution to the state's economy and employment. As per the Census 2011, about 70% of the workforce is engaged in agriculture either as a cultivator or agricultural laborers. The availability of fertile alluvial soil, adequate rainfall, and other favorable agro-climatic conditions provide a congenial environment for the cultivation of a variety of food grains, vegetables, fruits, spices, and other commercial crops.
The government of Bihar has taken various policy and institutional initiatives in the last 15 years under the three Agricultural Road Maps which have transformed the agricultural landscape of the state. The investments made by the state government in the areas of irrigation and rural infrastructure, as laid out in the Agriculture Road Maps, have boosted agricultural outputs, increased crop yields, and enhanced diversification. The production of cereals in the state has reached 181 Lakh MT in 2021-22 from 113.4 Lakh MT in 2007-08. Similarly, the production of fruits has increased to 49.77 Lakh MT from 32.52 Lakh MT, while that of vegetables has risen to 178.4 Lakh MT from 140.6 Lakh MT in 2007-08.
Bihar is self-sufficient in the production of food grains, and the focus has now shifted to the management of surplus to ensure that the gains in production and productivity are translating into higher prices. An efficient agricultural marketing ecosystem in the state will ensure that farmers are getting the optimal price for agricultural produce. The state government has established the Bihar Agricultural Produce Value Addition System (BAVAS) in the Department of Agriculture for the development of the agricultural marketing ecosystem in the state. The division is making concerted efforts to improve farmers' access to markets by working in the areas of infrastructure development for domestic and international trade, bridging information gaps, adopting digital technologies, and providing support to farmers’ collectives.
Progress So Far
The state government has accorded top priority to the development of agriculture and allied sectors with the roadmap-based strategy. Agriculture Roadmap-based strategies helped the state achieve a very high level of production and productivity of food grains. The second roadmap helped farmers improve their market access through improved rural connectivity and enhanced storage capacity in the state through the construction of new godowns. The storage capacity in the state increased by more than three times by the end of the second roadmap.
Provisions of previous roadmaps have also boosted the growth of the food processing industry in the state, which has contributed to a higher amount of value addition activities. More than 300 food processing units were started in the state during the second agriculture roadmap.
The third agriculture roadmap paved the way for the renovation and development of government agricultural market yards, with work on renovation started in 22 agricultural produce market yards. Basic infrastructure such as internal roads, drainage systems, toilet blocks, high mast lights, etc., were developed in these market yards. To bridge the information gap between farmers and markets, the department also started the collection and dissemination of price and arrival data from 100 market nodes.
Fourth Agriculture Roadmap (2023-28)
The fourth Agriculture Roadmap in the state envisages the strengthening and development of the agricultural marketing ecosystem by providing systemic interventions, creating enabling infrastructure, and assisting various stakeholders. For a holistic development of the agricultural marketing ecosystem in Bihar, an action plan for the overall development of government agricultural market yards, promotion of agricultural exports, strengthening of the farmer producer organization ecosystem, and development of rural hats will be implemented. The Department of Agriculture will implement various proposed activities with the following objectives:
a) To enable the farmers of the State to increase their access to remunerative markets
b) To strengthen the agricultural marketing ecosystem by improving market infrastructure and providing other enabling infrastructure for agribusinesses to flourish
c) To promote the export of agricultural produce from the State by developing and strengthening the agri-export ecosystem



4. To Increase the Use and Adoption of Digital Initiatives to Enhance Efficiency and Transparency in the Agricultural Marketing Ecosystem
Summary of DPRs for Proposed Activities
Development of Government Agricultural Produce Market Yards
Recognizing the importance of agricultural produce market yards in the state, the government has prioritized the work of renovation and modernization of all 54 market yards in the state under the fourth agriculture roadmap. These market yards will be linked to the e-NAM platform, which will facilitate the integration of these market yards with a common national-level online marketing platform, facilitating pan-India trade of agricultural commodities from these market yards.
To provide real-time market information, the existing system of collection of price and arrival data through the AGMARKNET platform will further be strengthened by integrating the AGMARKNET portal with the BIHAN App of the Government of Bihar and developing a state-level information and intelligence platform.
The department has prepared a comprehensive policy for the allotment of assets in the market yards (Bihar Policy for Allotment of Assets in Agricultural Produce Market Yards) which will ensure the allotment of assets in the agriculture market yards in a fair, transparent, and inclusive manner. The Policy for allotment of assets in the market yard has been included in the DPR for development of government agriculture market yards. Community institutions like Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs)/Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and their federations have been provided preferential treatment in the allotment of assets by making provisions for reservations and relaxations in eligibility conditions.
Further, the department will also bring a policy for the management and maintenance of market yards. Provisions of this policy will ensure the long-term sustainability of the assets being created in market yards.
To facilitate activities related to the marketing of agricultural products in the state and ensure that farmers can get fair and remunerative prices, a ‘Directorate of Agricultural Marketing’ will be established within the department. The directorate will implement various proposals and other marketing-related schemes and policies envisaged under the Agriculture Roadmap and will work closely with farmers, traders, and other stakeholders.
The initiatives related to the development of government agriculture market yards will support farmers in getting remunerative prices, provide impetus to the food processing industry in the state, and will create opportunities for employment generation in the state.
Development of Rural Hats
After the repeal of the ‘Agricultural Produce Marketing Act’ in 2006, the bulk of the transactions of agricultural products shifted to the farm gates. It has led to the emergence of small unorganized wholesale and consumer markets commonly known as rural hats. These hats function as periodic markets and operate mostly twice or thrice a week. As per the report of the Standing Committee on Agriculture (2018-2019), about 1,794 Grameen Haats exist in Bihar. The lack of basic infrastructure and facilities such as platforms, covered sheds, storage facilities, drinking water, and sanitation facilities leads to significant losses of agricultural produce and also restricts the functioning of these markets.
Improving the infrastructure facilities in these haats will increase the efficiency of these haats through efficient price discovery, reduced transaction costs, and increased competition between buyers and sellers. These haats will also be linked with the larger market yards, improving the efficiency of market yards by integrating the supply chain of commodities. These initiatives will facilitate higher price realization for farmers, minimize post-harvest losses, and develop a competitive market closer to the farm gate.
Promotion of FPO Ecosystem in Bihar
Agriculture in the state is dominated by small and marginal farmers who face multiple challenges related to small volumes of marketable surpluses and limited access to critical agricultural inputs and services. Recognizing these needs of smallholders, the collectivization of smallholders through farmer-producer organizations (FPOs) has gained substantial momentum in the state in the last few years.
However, most of the FPOs in the state are in a nascent stage and are facing multiple challenges related to capacity building, access to credit, and market linkage. The Government of Bihar will work for the overall development of the FPO ecosystem in the state and will take steps to address the multiple challenges being faced by FPOs and other stakeholders.
Promotion of FPO Ecosystem in Bihar
The Government of Bihar has prepared an umbrella policy (Bihar FPO Promotion Policy) for facilitating the development of the FPO ecosystem in Bihar. The policy will support building an enabling environment for the promotion of sustainable Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) in Bihar and will support FPOs, promoting organizations, and other stakeholders in addressing various challenges faced by them. The proposed policy for the promotion of the FPO ecosystem in Bihar has been included in the DPR for promotion of the FPO ecosystem in Bihar.
To streamline the efforts for the overall development of the FPO ecosystem in the state, Bihar Small Farmers Agribusiness Consortium (BSFAC) under the Department of Agriculture shall work as the nodal agency in the state. BSFAC will undertake initiatives to support FPOs, promoting organizations, and other stakeholders to support them in addressing their challenges.
Capacity-building exercises such as residential training, certificate courses, short-duration trainings, and exposure visits to best-performing FPOs will be undertaken. These initiatives will enhance the capacity of FPO Board members, lead farmers, accountants, and other staff of FPOs. To streamline training and capacity-building initiatives, BAMETI shall be designated as the dedicated State Level training institution for FPOs.
FPOs in Bihar are mostly in the early stages of business development and often face difficulties in accessing institutional finance at affordable rates. Schemes will be formulated to provide seed fund/initial capital to nascent FPOs. The scheme will be used to build a corpus with financial institutions for lending to FPOs in Bihar at a concessional rate of interest. In addition to this, the government will also facilitate the setting up and operationalization of a blended revolving corpus fund with eligible financial institutions to provide low-interest rate working capital assistance to FPOs.
To support FPOs in the marketing of agricultural produce, BSFAC shall organize buyer-seller meetings/tie-ups to promote FPOs' engagement/tie-ups with various procurement companies, traders, exporters, and other stakeholders. These events will help in generating more business, meeting national and international buyers, forging new strategic partnerships, and gaining industry knowledge.
The initiatives will help in the development of financially viable and sustainable Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) in the state of Bihar, thereby increasing the incomes of farmers by providing an enabling ecosystem for leveraging the economies of scale.
Promotion of Agri-Exports from Bihar
The rising growth in agriculture and allied sectors in Bihar offers ample scope and opportunity for entering global value chains to earn foreign exchange and enable producers to earn higher prices for their farm produce. With more than 70% of the population of Bihar engaged in the agriculture sector, linking the production in these sectors to the export markets is one of the best ways to stimulate growth and thereby expand the farmers' markets substantially, enhancing income opportunities for producers.
Export orientation of the agriculture sector coupled with quality produce, sizeable processing industry, and strong domestic market are some of the prerequisites for harnessing the true export potential of Bihar. The Government of Bihar has prepared a comprehensive policy to encourage and promote the exports of agriculture and allied sector products from Bihar. The policy will create an enabling environment for export promotion and will enhance the level of processing, storage, reducing post-harvest losses, value addition, and trade facilitation, thereby generating higher income returns for farmers and contributing to India's vision of increasing agricultural exports.
Bihar is a landlocked state and its exporters are competitively disadvantaged against states that have sea coasts and an international airport. Exporters of horticultural produce such as fruits, vegetables, and flowers also face significant risk of quality deterioration. To make the exports from Bihar price competitive with other states, the government will bring a comprehensive freight assistance scheme for exporters of agricultural products. Exports of fresh horticultural produce (fruits, vegetables, flowers) will also be incentivized in the form of packaging assistance.
The insistence on quality of agricultural/food products being imported in high-value markets across the globe is a major concern for exporters due to stringent quality norms. To meet such stringent norms, processors/manufacturers will be encouraged for implementation and certification of Food Safety Management Systems. The Government of Bihar shall provide assistance to exporters/processing units to implement certifications such as ISO, HACCP, TQM, KOSHER, etc.
Aggressive market access and market penetration are required to increase the share of exports from Bihar to newer markets. The government will undertake targeted promotional activities including participation in international exhibitions, organizing fairs, in-store marketing, brand promotion, etc., and shall organize aggressive international marketing and branding of local ethnic and GI products to gain the market advantage for such products.
The proposed initiatives will encourage and promote the exports of agriculture and allied sector products from Bihar by creating an enabling environment for the export of agricultural commodities. It will also enhance the level of value addition in the state, leading to higher prices for agricultural products and thereby generating higher income for farmers.
Other Initiatives
* The department will implement the agricultural marketing policies/programmes/schemes of both state and central government for the integrated development of marketing of agricultural and other allied produce in the state. It will coordinate with various agencies to increase the market access of farmers and safeguard the interests of farmers.
* The department shall facilitate the development of export-enabling infrastructures such as integrated pack houses, centers for perishable cargo, cold chains, food processing industries, common facility centers, NABL accredited laboratory labs, etc., in convergence by leveraging the benefits/incentives already being provided under the various policies/schemes of the Government of Bihar, Government of India, and other central/state government agencies.
* The department shall coordinate and leverage support from the central government and other concerned agencies for the implementation of Price Support Schemes for the procurement of commodities from time to time as per the requirements.
Preliminary Analysis and Challenges
On the basis of a preliminary analysis and discussion with key stakeholders, the Department of Agriculture has identified various challenges at different stages:
* Pre-Production
* Production
* Harvesting
* Post-Harvest Management
* Marketing and Value Addition
The various crops covered under the preliminary analysis are maize, wheat, rice, onion, potato, makhana, banana, mango, and litchi. The identified challenges have been mapped to interventions required to address them. Some of the suggested interventions are already included as part of the existing activities proposed under the agriculture roadmap, while the remaining activities will be taken up separately by the department.



Soil and Water Conservation Program
Introduction
Conservation of natural resources like soil and water plays an important role in the development of agriculture in an agricultural state like Bihar. Due to climate change and an increase in global temperature, irregularity in the timing and quantity of rains and a decrease in rainfall have been observed in recent years. The per capita availability of water is decreasing every year, which, coupled with a rapidly growing population and increasing needs of a developing state, is affecting agricultural productivity. Additionally, the continuous decline in ground water levels due to dependence on groundwater for irrigation further compounds the issue. Therefore, there is a need to promote and strengthen activities related to water conservation and water use management in the state by adopting a holistic and integrated approach.
The districts of southern Bihar are dominated by barren land, and farmers mainly depend on monsoon for irrigation. In these rain-fed areas, water scarcity, rapid decline in groundwater levels, and significant soil erosion are prevalent. Evaporation is also high due to elevated temperatures. Thus, sufficient water availability for farming is a concern. The problem of soil erosion is acute in southern Bihar, with fertile soil being washed away with rainwater into river drains. Maintaining agricultural productivity without adopting soil and water conservation techniques seems impossible.
To address these issues, the Directorate of Soil Conservation, Agriculture Department, and Bihar Watershed Development Society are implementing various schemes in 18 districts: Banka, Munger, Jamui, Nawada, Gaya, Aurangabad, Rohtas, Kaimur, Lakhisarai, Sheikhpura, Nalanda, Patna, Jehanabad, Arwal, Bhojpur, Bhagalpur, Buxar, and Begusarai. These schemes include:
* Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana - Watershed Development Component
* Construction of pucca check dams up to 30 feet under Saat Nischay-2
* Soil and Water Conservation Schemes under the State Plan
Activities under these schemes include land levelling, field bunding, check dam construction, pond construction, ahar-pyne renovation, silt detention dams, and community irrigation wells. Adoption of these technologies has proven effective in maintaining field water and soil. The Watershed Development Programme for natural resource conservation, especially soil and water, has been successful, incorporating multi-level methods from ridge to valley, community participation, capacity building, and promoting livelihood and productivity systems.
Brief Achievements of the Last Three Agricultural Road Maps
Under the last three agricultural road maps (2007-2023), the Directorate of Soil Conservation and Bihar Watershed Development Society implemented various schemes in 17 districts: Banka, Munger, Jamui, Nawada, Gaya, Aurangabad, Rohtas, Kaimur, Lakhisarai, Sheikhpura, Nalanda, Patna, Jehanabad, Arwal, Bhojpur, Bhagalpur, and Buxar. The schemes included:
* Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana - Watershed Development
* Construction of pucca check dams up to 30 feet in Saat Nischay-2
* Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (Per Drop More Crop)
* Green Revolution Scheme for Eastern India under RKVY
* Soil and Water Conservation Schemes under the State Plan
A total of 64 projects were successfully implemented under the Integrated Watershed Management Program (IWMP) Batch-III (2011-12) and Batch-IV (2012-13). This resulted in the treatment of 311,993 hectares in 8 districts of South Bihar: Aurangabad, Rohtas, Kaimur, Gaya, Nawada, Jamui, Munger, and Banka.
Additional achievements include:
* Construction of 37,034 structures under various schemes, including:
   * 10,297 water harvesting ponds of different sizes
   * 6,964 ahar-pyne renovations
   * 2,051 pucca check dams
   * 722 community pond renovations
   * 4,324 silt detention dams
   * 979 earthen check dams
   * Field bunding in 3,131 hectares
   * 1,498 irrigation wells
   * 7,068 other structures like continuous contour trench, staggered contour trench, private and community borewells, etc.
A total of 80,206 hectares of additional irrigation potential has been created. According to a survey by the Public Health Engineering Department (PHED) in 8 districts of South Bihar, groundwater levels have increased from 4 feet to 17 feet, which has been appreciated by NITI Aayog, Government of India. As a result of the construction of soil and water conservation structures and increased groundwater levels, farmers are now able to take more than one crop per year, leading to increased cropping intensity and crop productivity in the project area.
Priority of Fourth Agriculture Road Map
In view of the achievements of the previous three Agriculture Road Maps, the Fourth Agriculture Road Map (2023-28) is based on:
* Conservation of Natural Resources: Soil and water
* Promotion of Livelihood: Advancement of productivity systems in rain-fed areas of southern Bihar
The plan includes:
* Land levelling
* Construction of check dams
* Aahar-Pyne renovation
* Construction of silt detention dams
* Ponds, etc.
Additionally, other activities such as Livelihood Support and Productivity Systems for landless households are proposed in rain-fed areas of Southern Bihar. After discussions with technical experts for the agricultural road map, it was decided that:
* Provision of funds should be made for continuous monitoring, maintenance, and partial repair of the structures built under various schemes.
* A provision of 10 percent of the total financial target will be made in the state plan for repair and maintenance of previously constructed structures.
To address issues such as dependence on monsoon for agriculture, climate change, excess rain-fed areas, low income, poverty, unemployment, and food security in rain-fed areas, soil and water conservation works will be done under the state plan. Areas identified under watershed development component 2.0 will be treated, and pucca check dams up to 30 feet will be constructed under Saat Nischay-2. These schemes will be implemented in 18 districts of the state:
