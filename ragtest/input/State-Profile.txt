 STATUS OF AGRICULTURE IN BIHAR
2.1 Introduction
Bihar has a total geographical area of 93.60 lakh hectares on which it houses a population of 82.9 million, thereby generating a population density of 880 persons per sq. km (Census 2001). Gross sown area in the State is 79.46 lakh hectares, while net sown area is 56.03 lakh hectares. There are around 1.04 crore landholdings in the State, of which around 83 percent are marginal holdings of size less than 1 hectare (Table 2.1). With around 90 percent of the total population living in rural areas, agriculture as the primary feeder of the rural economy continues to operate not only on margins of land but also on the margins of human enterprise, its productivity being among the lowest in the country. Without increasing returns to these margins, not much can be done realistically to develop the agricultural sector. Thus, agriculture continues to define both the potentialities and constraints to development in Bihar.
Agriculture in Bihar is crucially dependent on the monsoon. Although around 57 percent of its gross cultivated area is irrigated, irrigation itself is crucially dependent on the monsoon as it largely depends on the use of surface water. According to the soil quality and climatic conditions of the relevant areas, Bihar has been classified into 3 agro-climatic zones: North-West Alluvial Plain (Zone 1), North-East Alluvial Plain (Zone 2), and South Alluvial Plain (Zone 3), with the last zone being further classified into two sub-zones 3A and 3B (Table 2.2). Monsoon arrives earliest in the north-eastern Zone 2, which also receives the highest rainfall among all three zones. Zone 3 receives monsoon showers last of all three zones and also the least amount. Total irrigated area in the State is 45.67 lakh hectares, of which nearly 30 percent is fed by canal water. This highlights the monsoon dependence of even irrigated lands as catchment areas of nearly all the major rivers in the State are outside the state.
2.2 Agricultural Production in 2006-07
Kharif 2006 started with a probability of normal rainfall, but the deviation for the first showers of the monsoon was (-)48 percent. Rainfall in the month of June and July was normal, but was again below normal by 57 percent in August. It was again normal in the month of September. Finally, rainfall was 19 percent below normal for the entire monsoon. This seems to have adversely affected the area under cultivation. Area under paddy in the State according to the second advance estimate for Kharif 2006 was 31.30 lakh hectares (Table 2.3) against the target of 37.00 lakh hectares (Table 2.4). Similarly, area under wheat for Rabi 2006 stood at 20.34 lakh hectares, falling short of a target of 24.00 lakh hectares. Thus, there has been a fall in the area under foodgrains from 65.48 lakh hectares in 2005-06 to 61.55 lakh hectares in 2006-07 (Table 2.5). Under the conditions of deficient rainfall and a fall in acreage, foodgrain output is expected to register a fall over the figures for 2005-06. The second advance estimate of foodgrains for 2006-07 is 82.10 lakh MT. For Kharif 2006-07, foodgrain production has been estimated at 40.04 lakh MT over an area of 34.83 lakh hectares. For Rabi 2006-07, the estimate of foodgrain production is 42.06 lakh MT over an area of 26.73 lakh hectares. This is a fall of around 4 lakh MT from the previous year’s production of around 86 lakh MT. The effect of falling acreage on the production of foodgrains has, however, been moderated by an increase in yield from 12.39 qnts/hectare in 2005-06 to 13.34 qntls/hectare in 2006-07 (Table 2.6).
Cereal production is expected to fall by almost 3 lakh MT to 78 lakh MT as compared to the previous year’s production of 81 lakh MT (Table 2.7). This fall largely comes from a reduction in acreage under cereals by almost 9 lakh hectares. Within cereals, the fall in production is largely caused by a decrease in maize output by almost around 4 lakh MT. Other coarse cereals too are estimated to register a marginal fall in both acreage and production. While both rice and wheat are estimated to suffer a minor fall in acreage, their production is likely to improve over the previous year due to an increase in productivity (Table 2.5).
Production of pulses is also expected to fall marginally by 0.75 lakh MT in 2006-07 despite an increase in productivity. This is because of a substantive fall in the area under pulses by around 2 lakh hectares compared to the previous year. Oilseed production is expected to suffer a marginal fall from 1.19 lakh MT in 2005-06 to 1.11 lakh MT in 2006-07 due to a marginal fall in both acreage and productivity. Sugarcane has been planted on an area of 1.43 lakh hectares, and its output is estimated to be 12.33 lakh MT.

 
      2.3 Long-Term Trend in Foodgrains Production
Foodgrain production in Bihar has shown high volatility, but there is a long-term trend of falling production in the State. Cereal production has fallen sharply from 122.29 lakh MT in 2001-02 to 81.12 lakh MT in 2005-06 (Table 2.7). This fall in production has been accompanied by an almost secular decline in the area under cereal production from 70.19 lakh hectares in 1990-91 to 65.87 lakh hectares in 2006-07. A larger part of the fall in production and area is explained by the fall in production of and area under rice (Table 2.5). Though production of wheat too has fallen, the area under it has largely been unchanged at around 20 lakh hectares. The fall in production of wheat has been due to its declining yield. While its yield in the later half of the nineties hovered around 22 qtls/hect, it has steadily fallen thereafter, reaching 21.46 qtls/hect in 2000-01 and still lower at 13.94 qtls/hect in 2005-06 (Table 2.5). Pulses too have seen a fall in production and acreage, but the fall has been moderate. Their production has fallen from 5.47 lakh MT in 2001-02 to 4.83 lakh MT in 2005-06, with acreage falling in the corresponding period from 6.94 lakh hectares to 6.55 lakh hectares. While there has been a marginal fall in the productivity of pulses, their yield rates have remained significantly above the national average. Acreage and production of coarse cereals have largely been unchanged over the last few years. For maize, there has been a rise in production from around 12 lakh MT in the late nineties to nearly 15 lakh MT in 2005-06, with almost unchanged acreage and rising productivity, from around 20 qtls/hect to 23 qtls/hect over the same period. Acreage and production of oilseeds have more or less hovered around 1.4 lakh hectares and 1.2 lakh MT in recent years with moderate fluctuations.
The falling trend in production and acreage of cereals has been further aggravated by deficient rainfall in 2006-07. Total cereal production is estimated to be 78.05 lakh MT, which is around 3 lakh MT less than the production figure for 2005-06 (Table 2.5). For kharif 2006-07, cereal production has been estimated at 39.64 lakh MT over an area of 34.29 lakh hectares. For rabi 2006-07, the estimate of cereal production is 38.40 lakh MT over an area of 22.53 lakh hectares. The fall in production has been largely due to the fall in area from 65.87 lakh hectares in 2005-06 to 56.82 lakh hectares in 2006-07. The second advance estimates for 2006-07 have put the production figures for coarse cereals at 10.38 lakh MT on an area of 5.17 lakh hectares and a yield of 20.09 quintals/hectare. Production of pulses has been estimated at 4.05 lakh MT and that of oilseeds at 1.11 lakh MT. Estimates put the area under sugarcane cultivation at 1.43 lakh hectares with an output of 12.33 lakh MT.
The observed trend of fall in acreage and production of cereals, it might be noted, is not incidental. There has been a deliberate effort by the State government during the last five years to divert land under rice and wheat cultivation towards horticulture. The plan of crop diversion has been given priority in 12 districts of the state. About 30 percent of the area under wheat in the districts of Muzaffarpur, Darbhanga, Samastipur, and Madhubani (Zone 1 districts) is being considered for diversion towards mango, litchi, and makhana. Similarly, 20 percent of crop area in the districts of East Champaran, Samastipur, Khagaria, Muzaffarpur, and Vaishali is being considered for diversion towards banana. Further, about 20 percent of rice-wheat area in the districts of Buxar, Bhojpur, Sasaram, etc. is likewise being considered for diversion towards vegetable production. Finally, about 30 percent of the total area of the state is being considered for diversion from current crops towards new crops.

  
 
 
 
  
  
 
2.4 Flood Control and Drainage
Every year, Bihar faces the vagaries of floods and waterlogging. After the bifurcation of the State, Bihar has become the most flood-prone area in the country. The total flood-prone area of the State is 2168.80 lakh hectares, which is 73.06 percent of its total geographical area and 17.2 percent of the total flood-prone area in the country. The flood situation is most severe in the northern plains of Bihar. This is because almost all the major rivers in the State enter Bihar from Nepal in this region. The bed slope of these rivers is very sharp in Nepal, and they usually enter the State on plain lands. Because of a sudden drop in bed slope, silt brought by the flow of these rivers gets deposited at their base, causing recurring floods.
While a long-term solution to this problem can be achieved by constructing dams at the upper catchments of Kosi, Gandak, Bagmati, and Mahananda rivers in Nepal territory, in the short run, Bihar has to depend on the construction and maintenance of embankments along the rivers. Till March 2006, 3430.47 km length of embankments have been constructed in the State, which protect 29.16 lakh hectares of area, out of a total of 68.80 lakh hectare flood-prone area. Thus, 39.64 lakh hectares of land area still stands exposed to the perennial problem of floods. Despite such high exposures to the threat of floods, only 29 percent of the total 10th Plan allocation for flood control has been utilized (Table 2.8). A more efficient utilization of the allocated funds would have lessened the damage capacity of floods in the State.
Besides the menace of floods, about 9.41 lakh hectares of land suffer from the problem of waterlogging in Bihar. It has been found by various Expert Committees that it would not be economically viable to free 2.5 lakh hectares of land from waterlogging due to excessive depth. Thus, against 6.91 lakh hectares of waterlogged area from where water can be drained out, only about 1.50 lakh hectares have been freed from waterlogging. The task ahead is to free the remaining 5.41 lakh hectares of land area. Against a total agreed outlay of around Rs 167 crore on drainage works in the 10th Plan, there has been an actual utilization of around 74 percent (Table 2.9).
2.5 Irrigation
Bihar is richly endowed with water resources and has a very healthy rainfall average of 1271.9 mm. The ultimate irrigation potential in the State is estimated to be around 102 lakh hectares, which is far above the total cultivated area in the State (Table 2.10). However, neither rainfall nor the distribution of the water resources is uniform across the State, causing uneven irrigation potential/coverage across the State. While Zone-2 (Table 2) receives earliest showers and highest rainfall (1450 mm) among all three agro-climatic zones in the State, Zone-3 receives an average rainfall of only 1115 mm.
Bihar has 45.67 lakh hectares of irrigated area against its total geographical area of 93.6 lakh hectares. While the created irrigation capacity of 45.67 lakh hectares means that around 49 percent of the total area is irrigated, the distribution of irrigation capacity is not even across the State. The percentage of irrigated area varies greatly across different regions/districts, from a low of 16 percent (in Jamui) to around 86 percent (in Sheikhpura). In fact, both irrigation capacity and its source vary greatly across the 3 agro-climatic Zones of the State.
While Zone 1 accounts for nearly 37 percent of the total geographical area of the State, its share in total created irrigation capacity of the State is about 31 percent (Table 2.11). On the other hand, Zone 3B, which also accounts for 31 percent of the geographical area, has about 41 percent of total irrigated land in the State. Zone 3A, having 13 percent of the geographical area of the State, has only around 8 percent of the total irrigated area. Finally, while around 64 percent of Zone 3B area is irrigated, Zone 3A has only around 32 percent of its area irrigated.
This variation in irrigation capacity across the regions also extends to the sources of irrigation. Nearly 63 percent of total created irrigation capacity in the State has tubewells as its source (Table 2.12). Canal irrigation accounts for nearly 30 percent of the total irrigated area. Thus, major and medium sources of irrigation together account for 93 percent of total created irrigation capacity in the State, with other sources (minor and micro irrigation) accounting for only about 7 percent of total irrigation. A very high dependence on irrigation on tube wells, and operation of diesel tubewells due to lack of power infrastructure in the rural areas means a high cost and inefficient irrigation.
The variation in irrigation source has a very clear pattern across the agro-climatic zones of the State. While nearly 50 percent of irrigation in Zone 3B has canal as its source, only 13 percent of the irrigated area in Zone 2 receives canal irrigation. Reliance on tubewells is very high in Zones 1 and 2 (source of 85 percent of Zone 1’s irrigated area). On the other hand, canals have a greater role to play in Zones 3A and 3B, and there is a greater balance between tubewell and canal irrigation in these regions. Incidentally, the latter two zones are also the zones with the lowest rainfall among all the regions of the State. Thus, while the importance of canal irrigation is much greater in the southern parts of Bihar (Zone 3), there is an almost exclusive reliance on tubewell irrigation in the northern parts, especially in Zone 2. This is rather peculiar as most of the rivers in Bihar flow through its northern plains, which therefore should have had a better canal irrigation capacity.
Minor and micro irrigation have only a limited coverage in the overall irrigation scenario of the State, accounting for only 7.53 percent of the irrigated area. Here too, there is a great deal of variation in its use across the State. While only 2 percent of the irrigated area of Zone 2 has minor irrigation as its source, its contribution to irrigated area in Zone 3 is around 17 percent.
Groundwater resources have remained largely unutilized in the State. To tap the huge potential of groundwater irrigation, the Million Shallow Tubewell Programme has been prepared, which would imply additional irrigation capacity of 20 lakh hectares. About 6.97 lakh diesel tubewells and pumpsets are to be distributed by March 2007 under this programme. Farmers are given a grant of 30 percent and a loan of 50 percent of total costs under this Programme, and no discrimination is made between different categories of beneficiary farmers. Against the distribution target of 5.37 lakh pumpsets by March 2006, 3.80 lakh pumpsets were distributed by November 2005.
On-farm water management programme is being run in all the 38 districts of the State, under which shallow pumpsets, normal pumpsets, and other micro irrigation sources are being arranged. Watershed development programme is being run under which water-generating ponds and other devices of groundwater regeneration are being constructed to develop and improve water utilization capacity in the State. In this direction, 5 lakh trees have been planted in 8 districts of the State under the agro-forestry programme towards developing water utilization capacity. Sprinkler sets and HDPIP pipes are being distributed in the State under the Centrally sponsored ISOPOM plan for the production of pulses, oilseeds, and maize. By March 2006, additional irrigation capacity of 18,000 hectares of land was created under this programme. Against the target to create additional irrigation capacity of 2.39 lakh hectares in 2006-07, an additional irrigation capacity of 1.76 lakh hectares was created by September 2006. In the 10th Plan, the actual outlay on irrigation was Rs 1980 crore, which was only about 60 percent of the total agreed outlay on irrigation (Table 2.13). A substantial portion of this outlay was on major and medium irrigation.
2.6 Agricultural Inputs
Seeds
Agriculture in Bihar has been bedeviled by a trend of falling productivity over the last few years. Major crops, particularly rice and wheat, which together account for 77.26 percent of the total cropped area, have seen a substantive fall in their productivity in recent years. Falling productivity of the agricultural sector in Bihar, despite its rich soil endowment, can be partly explained by the limited availability of good quality seed and a very poor seed replacement rate.
Seed replacement rate for cereals is about 10-12 percent, for gram it is 7.5 percent, and for rapeseed and mustard, it is 30 percent (Table 2.14). The seed replacement ratio for paddy has increased from 6.8 percent in 2003-04 to 10 percent in 2004-05 to 12 percent in 2005-06. This ratio for wheat was 10 percent in 2004-05 and 11 percent in 2005-06. These rates are much below the desirable 30-35 percent for self-pollinated crops and 50 percent for cross-pollinated crops. In other states, the seed replacement for paddy is at 50 percent in Andhra Pradesh, the rate for wheat is 41 percent in Maharashtra, for gram it is 30 percent in Orissa, and for rapeseed and mustard, it is 100 percent in Gujarat. However, the seed replacement ratios for oilseeds and maize in the State meet the desired norms, standing at 30 percent for rapeseeds and mustard, and 40 percent for rabi maize, which is reflected in their yield being above the national average.

 
    
 
Seed Replacement Rate and Seed Consumption
Seed Replacement Rate (2006)
The target seed replacement rate for pulses in 2006 was 14 percent for kharif and 10 percent for rabi seasons respectively. The seed replacement target for oilseeds and vegetables was 30 percent and 60 percent respectively. There has been an increase in seed consumption of paddy and wheat in the State in recent years. While seed consumption for paddy has increased sharply from 72.26 thousand quintals in 2001-02 to 194.25 thousand quintals in 2005-06, the same for wheat has increased moderately from 190.64 thousand quintals to 237.85 thousand quintals over the same period (Table 2.15). This increase in seed consumption in the backdrop of their falling acreage is explained by an increase in seed replacement ratio and increasing use of HYVs for these crops. The acreage of paddy under HYVs has increased by almost 4 percent over the period 1999-2005, and that of wheat under HYVs has increased by around 2 percent over the same period (Table 2.16). Arrangements have been made to supply 48,000 quintals of maize seeds, 3,500 quintals of arhar, 1,400 quintals of urad, and 420 quintals of moong for kharif 2006. Seed requirement for rabi-2006 has been estimated at 300 thousand quintals. The estimate for maize seeds in rabi-2006 was 60 thousand quintals.
For several years, Bihar State Seed Corporation had become non-functional and agricultural farms of the State government were lying barren. In the current financial year, the State government has approved restarting seed production by Bihar State Seed Corporation for the next five years with an outlay of Rs. 27.12 crore. Seed production for paddy has started on 45 agricultural farms in the last kharif season, and 10,000 quintals of HYV paddy seeds have been produced. In the current rabi season, a program for the production of wheat seeds is being carried out. This would facilitate timely and economical availability of modern crop breeds to the farmers.
Fertilisers
Fertiliser consumption in the State has steadily increased over the years. The consumption of fertilizers has increased from 85 kgs/hectare to 110 kgs/hectare in 2005-06 (Table 2.18). The estimated consumption for 2006-07 is 125 kgs/hectare. For 2006, the State government has estimated the fertilizer consumption to be 9 lakh MT of urea, 3 lakh MT of DAP, 90,000 MT of MOP, 1.5 lakh MT of NPK, and 60,000 MT of SSP, 90 percent of which has been allocated by the Central government. Despite an increase over the years, fertilizer consumption per hectare in the State is lower than the national average. Besides the low level, an important problem is the distorted consumption pattern of fertilizers in the State. While the ideal ratio of NPK consumption should be 4:2:1, the consumption pattern in Bihar has become increasingly distorted over the years (Table 2.19). The NPK ratio has worsened from around 12:3:1 in 2000-01 to 24:2:1 in 2003-04, but fortunately improved to 7:1:1 in 2005-06. This problem, along with others, is being addressed by the extension initiatives of the State government, such as the establishment of soil testing laboratories and Krishi Vikas Kendras (KVK) in each block.
Credit
From an already low level, agriculture’s share in total bank credit has fallen over the last 5 years. While its share was at 24 percent in 2000-01, it fell to 20 percent in 2003-04. Though it has registered an increase to 23 percent in 2004-05, it is still lower than the share in 2000-01. The entire rural credit delivery system is not in good shape in Bihar. In terms of access of cultivators to the banking institutions, the average population per bank branch in Bihar, as of the end of June 2006, was 25,000, as against the national average of 16,000 (RBI 2006). While the number of commercial bank branches in the State is 2,082, only 60.37 percent of these branches operate in rural areas. There are 5 Regional Rural Banks in the State, with 1,486 branches, of which around 86 percent are located in rural areas. The credit-deposit ratio (CDR) of RRBs at 44.77 percent is much higher than those of commercial banks.
Taking the entire banking sector, a total of 4,015 branches of 72 banks cater to the 82.9 million strong population of the State (Table 2.20). Even this sparse banking infrastructure is disproportionately oriented towards the urban economy of the State, with only 72 percent of total branches catering to the rural areas which are home to nearly 90 percent of the population. Total allocation of credit to agriculture in Bihar has been increasing over the last few years, but has remained way behind the target credit mark.
Commercial banks account for the largest share of the total credit disbursed to agriculture in the State, though this share has fallen moderately in recent years, from 70.30 percent in 2002-03 to 68.51 percent in 2005-06 (Table 2.21). Total outstanding credit as of March 2005 of all scheduled commercial banks to agriculture stood at Rs. 2,973.52 crore, out of which direct credit was Rs. 2,634.49 crore and indirect credit was Rs. 339.03 crore. The share of regional rural banks in total agricultural credit has fluctuated around 20 percent, although it registered a sharp fall in 2003-04 to 13 percent. Similarly, the share of cooperative banks in total agricultural credit is found to be about 12 percent, although it was suddenly high at 36 percent in 2003-04.
The agricultural credit need was estimated to be Rs. 11,341.22 crore for Bihar in 2006-07. An amount of Rs. 10,042 crore for crop loans, Rs. 78.22 crore for the Macromode/ISOPAM plan, Rs. 60 crore for micro-irrigation, Rs. 18.50 crore for agri-clinics, and Rs. 1,142 crore for horticulture mission etc. would be needed as a loan from the banking sector. However, the credit target for agriculture set by banks for 2006-07 was only Rs. 3,732 crore, which was much lower than the requirement. Kisan Credit Card (KCC) is an important medium for increasing agricultural credit. At present, there are 1.04 crore land holdings in the State, but till 2005-06, only 1,450,779 KCCs have been distributed against the target of 3,047,536. To meet the target of crop loans of Rs. 10,042 crore in 2006-07, KCCs have to play a very important role. Although total disbursement under KCC has increased almost 2.5 times, from Rs. 342 crore in 2002-03 to Rs. 815 crore in 2005-06 (Table 2.22), it still channels only a minuscule proportion of the total credit volume for crop loans. A target of 6 lakh more KCCs has been fixed by the banks for 2006-07. But even this target is grossly inadequate to measure up to the total credit demand in the current year. In the area of micro-finance, more than 17,000 Self-Help Groups had been financed by banks up to 2005 through their priority lending schemes in 38 districts. The target for 2006-07 is to raise the number to 24,000 SHGs and advance Rs. 48 crore through the scheme.
Insurance
Agricultural production in Bihar has shown great fluctuation over the years. On one hand, this fluctuation can be devastating for a small-margin farmer who operates on the limits of subsistence, and on the other hand, it is a disincentive for enterprising farmers who have the potential for investment. In this perspective, crops in the State are being insured since kharif 2000 to provide economic help to the insured farmers whose crops are damaged by natural disasters. Kharif crops such as paddy, maize, jute, and chillies, and among rabi crops, wheat, gram, arhar, masoor, maize, rapeseed and mustard, potato, sugarcane, and onion are covered under the National Agricultural Insurance Plan. While participation of indebted farmers is compulsory in the plan, that of non-indebted farmers is voluntary.
Under this plan, grants are given in the premium to be paid by the small and marginal farmers, with equal shares of State and Central government. The number of beneficiary farmers for 2004-05 was 411,532, with 293,442 in kharif and 118,090 in rabi season. There has been a drop in coverage of farmers under crop insurance in 2005-06 as compared to 2004-05. Crop insurance policy was taken by 409,946 farmers in 2005-06, out of which 221,985 took cover for the kharif season and 187,961 for the rabi season. Insurance coverage in Bihar is inadequate considering that there are around 10.4 million landholdings in the State, with nearly 93 percent being small and marginal holdings requiring protection through the insurance plan.
Extension Services
The importance of agricultural research and extension to farmers cannot be overemphasized. In Bihar, there is a significant gap between the technology available in agricultural universities/institutions and that on the field. Public Sector Agricultural Research and Extension System in the State involves Rajendra Agricultural University for research and education, seven research centers/stations of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, and various State government departments for agricultural extension and regulatory services. However, the agricultural research and extension system has not been fully effective in developing and disseminating appropriate technologies. The national level spending on agricultural research stands at 0.4 percent of agricultural GDP, whereas Bihar's spending is only 0.2 percent of agricultural GDP. Of this, 95 percent is on salaries and only 5 percent for establishment expenses.
According to NSSO 2003 figures, only 0.5 percent of farmers access information on modern technology from extension workers. Recent steps to address this situation include the universalization of Agricultural Technology Management Agencies (ATMAs) and Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) to cover all districts of the State. Additionally, 31 new soil-testing laboratories were sanctioned this financial year, adding to the existing 23. Furthermore, a mega-project of Rs. 309 crore has been sanctioned to establish soil testing laboratories in all 534 blocks over the next 4 years.

 2.6 Seed Supply Management
Management of seed supply is an important component of any programme of agricultural development. In the current year, Bihar State Seed Corporation has been revived and production of seeds is being undertaken by it on 45 state-managed farms which remained inoperative for some years. More than 1100 agriculture graduates have been trained as agriclinics in the State. The utilization of technical expertise of these trained youths is necessary for agricultural development. A decision was taken in the current year to use the seeds produced by agriclinics for public sector programmes. In the current year, the Kisan Samman Yojna was also launched to identify and acknowledge enterprising farmers in the State and using them as extension agents. This plan is a unique and innovative programme of extension reforms.
2.7 Horticulture
Bihar is one of the major producers of vegetables and fruits in India with 9.8 and 6.7 percent of national production respectively. It ranks third and sixth among other States in the production of vegetables and fruits respectively. Fruit area in the State is 2.91 lakh hectares which is around 7.8 percent of the total fruit area in the country (Table 2.23). In general, yield rates of fruits and vegetables are lower in Bihar than those of other States. However, they are among the highest for okra and litchis. The annual production of fresh fruits in Bihar is about 29.20 lakh MT. In addition, vegetables are grown in an area of 4.87 lakh hectares from which around 72.58 lakh MT of vegetables is produced (Table 2.24). Besides this, potato cultivation takes place in an area of 3.05 lakh hectares from which 53.07 lakh MT of potato are produced.
Makhana cultivation is done in about 5000 hectares in the entire country, 90 percent of which falls in Bihar. Projects for production of makhana, litchis, and mangoes are currently being promoted by NABARD under RSVY in the districts of Muzaffarpur, Darbhanga, Samastipur, and Madhubani. About 30 percent of the total area in the State is planned to be diverted from other crops towards horticulture. During the last two years, 2005-06 and 2006-07, plans for horticulture development are being run in the State with 100 percent grant from the Central government under the National Horticulture Mission (NHM). The districts left out by the NHM are being covered under the Chief Minister’s Horticulture Mission. This plan consists of expansion of area under fruit orchards, commercial flower cultivation, cultivation of medicinal plants, bee-keeping, integrated pest management, training of cultivators and officers, post-harvest management, etc. This plan is to be implemented in the public as well as private areas.
Approximately 25-40 percent of the vegetables and fruits are lost due to lack of proper transport and storage facilities. Because of these handicaps, fruits and vegetables produced in the State are mainly sold fresh in the market, often implying distress sale by the farmers. While mandi markets are the mandated sales outlet for fruits and vegetable products, yet just 6 percent of vegetable production and 4.2 percent of fruit production get shelf space in APMCs.
The State has been plagued by substantive losses of fruit and vegetable output affected by lack of adequate cold storage and godown capacity. Bihar has only 160 rural godowns (0.12 percent of the country’s godowns) with an approximate capacity of 17,000 tons, which compares very poorly with the figure of 3,015 rural godowns for Punjab, which is around 24 percent of the country’s capacity. Similarly, although Bihar produces about 10 percent of all vegetables and nearly 7 percent of all fruits, it has only 5 percent of the total storage capacity in India. Of the 238 cold storage units available, 187 are used for potatoes. Thus 77 percent of the capacity of these cold storage units are used to store potatoes alone, leaving only 23 percent for other purposes. The majority (92 percent) of the State’s cold storage facilities is owned by the private sector and the rest by the cooperatives (8 percent). The State has been adding to its storage and preservation capacities over the last few years. Under the Plan of cold storage construction, capacity expansion, and modernization in the State (with financial assistance from Central government), permission has been given for construction of 42 new cold storages since 2000, out of which 22 cold storages have started functioning and the remaining ones are under construction.
2.8 Forestry
Out of the total geographical area of 94,163 sq. kms. of the State, only 6473 sq. kms is under natural forests, which comprises only 6.87 percent of the total geographical area. Out of 38 districts, these forests are located in only 10 districts. According to the Forest Survey Institute, Dehradun, there are only 13.6 trees/hectare in the areas outside the forest regions of the State.
According to the Indian Forest Policy 1988, 33 percent of the geographical area should be under forests for environmental balance. In a densely populated region like Bihar, it is difficult to increase the area under forests. But it can be compensated by making alternative arrangements and using all the empty lands of the State. Under the already launched Kishore Chetna Vriksh Yojna, awareness about the environment, especially about trees, is sought to be created among the school students and their participation is being ensured in the afforestation programmes.
2.9 Animal Husbandry
Bihar’s livestock sector is crucial not only in terms of its contribution to rural income but also for the section of the population to which this income goes. Bihar’s livestock sector accounted for approximately one-quarter of the total value of agricultural output in TE 2002-03. Livestock activity is concentrated among landless households and those with marginal holdings of less than 1 hectare of land. Approximately 35 percent of rural households in Bihar report owning cattle, 20 percent buffalo, and 15 percent sheep and goats (NSSO 2003). Of all rural households owning cattle and/or buffalo in Bihar, more than three-quarters are either landless or have less than 1 hectare of land. Sheep and goats tend to be even more concentrated among landless and marginal rural households.
Milk is the most important livestock product, accounting for approximately 50 percent of the total livestock output, followed by meat (24 percent) and other livestock products. Milk production in Bihar has grown by around 92 percent over the period 2001-2006, while meat production has grown by only 12 percent over the same period. Similarly, egg production has increased by 35 percent over this period, while wool production has fallen by almost 50 percent (Table 2.25). According to the 2003 livestock census, there were approximately 10 million heads of cattle in Bihar, only 10 percent of which were cross-bred, which explains the low productivity and growth of livestock output in the State. The fact that the number of institutions providing extension services to the livestock sector has remained stagnant over the years has certainly not helped its productivity scenario (Table 2.26).
2.10 Fisheries and Poultry
There has been a steady increase in fish production in the State over the period 2001-02 to 2005-06 and its share in total agricultural GDP has nearly doubled in the last 10 years. However, its production is estimated to fall to 160 thousand MT in 2006-07 (Table 2.27) because seed has substantially fallen this year. Fishermen in the State are being trained to increase the productivity of the fisheries sector, and loans are being granted for maintenance and renovation of privately owned ponds in the State.
2.11 Agricultural Mechanisation
The current level of mechanization of agriculture in the State is very low. While there are only 17 tractors per hectare in the State, the figure for Punjab is 68 tractors per hectare. At present, Bihar has 111,672 tractors, 4,000 power tillers, 2.5 lakh stonery engines, 66,128 mould board ploughs, 50,000 cultivators, 15,000 seed drills, 290,000 sprayers, and 300,000 threshers. While recommended electricity consumption for farming is 2 KW/hect, it is only 0.8 KW/hect in Bihar due to limited availability of electricity. The Government is accordingly promoting agricultural mechanization on a large scale through the provision of grants for small tractors, power tillers, threshers, and GISE tillage machines.
2.12 Land and Agricultural Reforms
The available data for landholdings demonstrate the extent of inequality in the agrarian structure. For example, more than 80 percent of operational holdings in Bihar are marginal (below one hectare), and they account for only 36 percent of the total operational land area. At the other end, medium and large operational holdings of more than four hectares comprise less than 2.5 percent of all holdings but constitute over 20 percent of operational land area. In Bihar, the incidence of landlessness has increased in the decade of the nineties from 9 percent to 10 percent of the rural households, and the proportion of households in the marginal segment has also increased significantly in the same time period (Table 2.28).
Apart from the widening of disparity in land distribution, it can also be observed that while the incidence of poverty has declined for all landowning classes during the nineties, it has actually increased for the landless from 51 percent to 56 percent, strongly suggesting that land ownership is clearly associated with poverty. At the end of the nineties, therefore, the share of land-poor households in the total poor population has increased—from 12 to 14 percent for landless households and from 55 to 61 percent for marginal landholding households.
It is in this backdrop that the State government has constituted the Land Reforms Commission in June 2006 to look into the issues of land ceiling, land consolidation, and occupancy/tenancy rights. It also has been mandated to analyze the rural turmoil in the backdrop of land-related disputes and recommend remedial measures accordingly. The Commission is to look into the feasibility and impact of cooperative farming, giving due importance to the rights and concerns of the small and marginal farmers.
Policy Initiatives
The New Agricultural Policy was made by the State government in 2006 to build upon the natural advantages that the State has in agriculture. Its fertile land, huge water resources, and conducive climatic conditions imply tremendous potential for the agricultural sector. Despite this, productivity of crops in Bihar compares poorly with other states. Thus, at the core of the new agricultural policy for Bihar is the focus on increasing productivity of crops, not merely in comparison with the national average but in comparison with the best productivity standards achieved in any State in India. Following major initiatives have been taken by the State government in the last one year:
Food security, Increase in farmer’s income, Increase in crop productivity, and Environmental conservation have been fixed as the four targets of the new agricultural policy regime.
ATMAs have been constituted in 23 districts of the State which did not have its ATMA coverage under the centrally sponsored programme. Thus all the districts of the State now have ATMA coverage.
A megaproject for the establishment of soil testing laboratories in all 534 blocks of the State has been sanctioned, to take soil testing facilities right to the door of the farmers.
31 new seed testing laboratories are to be established in the State to give each district its own seed testing laboratory.
The Chief Minister Horticulture Mission has been started in 19 districts of the State which were not covered under National Horticulture Mission, thereby universalizing the programme in the State.
Micro-nutrient testing laboratories have been established in 3 districts of the State.
Research and Educational infrastructure of Rajendra Agricultural University, which happens to be the only agricultural university of the State, has been strengthened.
Agricultural Produce Marketing Board has been abolished.
Bihar State Seed Corporation has been revived, and seed production has been started on 45 state agricultural farms which were lying inoperative.
Farmers’ Commission has been established.
Land Reform Commission has been established.
