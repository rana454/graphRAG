Infrastructure Facilities for All Varieties of Fishes
The infrastructure facilities for hatchery and fish seed raising units should be indicative and not exhaustive, and may vary depending on different seed production facilities.
The appropriate level of flexibility can be allowed with respect to the construction and layout of the physical facilities at the time of verification, depending on local circumstances, provided that the specified capacities, water quality, and Brood stock assessment reports are compliant with the norms.
Components such as soil and water quality testing facilities, store rooms, staff quarters, and security systems are optional and should be built as per requirements and convenience.
