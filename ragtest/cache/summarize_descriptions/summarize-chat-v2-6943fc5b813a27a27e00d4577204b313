{"result": "Bihar and Kerala, two states in India, are often compared across various economic and demographic parameters. One such comparison focuses on the population within the economically active age group, where both states show distinct characteristics. In terms of agricultural finance, Bihar has much lower credit availability per hectare when compared to Kerala. This disparity is further highlighted when examining the agricultural credit flow per hectare between the two states, indicating Kerala's superior access to financial resources for agriculture. Additionally, Kerala boasts a significantly higher share of Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) in its total credit flow, underscoring a more robust cooperative credit structure in comparison to Bihar. This comprehensive analysis reveals the contrasting economic landscapes between Bihar and Kerala, especially in terms of credit availability and the structure of agricultural finance.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
