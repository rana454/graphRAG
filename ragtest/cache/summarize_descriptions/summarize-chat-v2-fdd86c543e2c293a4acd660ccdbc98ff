{"result": "The Central Government and State Government work closely together to manage and regulate the fertilizer industry within their jurisdiction. The Central Government has the authority to direct the State Government to report on any actions taken regarding the suspension or cancellation of fertilizer allocation. This collaborative relationship extends to the regulation of fertilizers for industrial purposes, where both governments work in conjunction to ensure proper use and compliance with established standards. Furthermore, the State Government plays a crucial role in the process of granting Certificates of Registration for Fertilizer sales, operating in alignment with the Central Government's regulations and guidelines.
