{"result": "Nepal, a country located to the north of Bihar and serving as one of its international borders, plays a significant role in the flood situation in the state. This is primarily due to major rivers originating from Nepal and entering Bihar, where a sharp drop in bed slope and the deposition of silt at the base of these rivers exacerbate flooding. Additionally, Nepal's significant portions of the Himalayas contribute to the catchment areas of these rivers, further influencing the floods in Bihar.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
