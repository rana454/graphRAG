{"result": "The Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act was legislation repealed in Bihar in 2006. The primary aim of repealing this act was to facilitate free trade in agriculture. By removing this legislation, the objective was to create an environment where agricultural trade could occur more freely, without the constraints previously imposed by the APMC Act. This move was seen as a step towards liberalizing the agricultural sector by allowing direct interaction between farmers and buyers, thereby potentially improving the efficiency and profitability of agricultural trade in the region.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
