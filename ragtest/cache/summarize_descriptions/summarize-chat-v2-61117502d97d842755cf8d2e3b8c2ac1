{"result": "Muzaffarpur and Gopalganj, both districts in Bihar, have experienced significant losses in their summer paddy areas. Despite this setback, they have shown resilience by expanding their gross cropped areas, a notable achievement amidst a general declining trend in agricultural land use across the state of Bihar. Additionally, these districts are key players in the tobacco industry, with notable shares in the tobacco area, contributing significantly to the state's tobacco production.
