{"result": "Samastipur and Vaishali, both situated in Bihar, are prominent for their tobacco cultivation, having seen an expansion in the area dedicated to this crop. These districts are notable for their maximum tobacco production, holding overwhelming shares in the state's tobacco area. In an effort to enhance agricultural productivity, Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) have introduced azolla culture in both districts, aiming to increase rice production.
