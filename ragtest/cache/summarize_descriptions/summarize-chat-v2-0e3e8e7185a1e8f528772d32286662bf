{"result": "The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) is a credit scheme in India designed to enhance agricultural credit by distributing credit cards to farmers across the country, including in regions like Bihar, which has a significant number of land holdings. Despite the large number of potential beneficiaries in areas such as Bihar, there has been an insufficient distribution of KCCs, highlighting a gap in the scheme's reach and effectiveness.
