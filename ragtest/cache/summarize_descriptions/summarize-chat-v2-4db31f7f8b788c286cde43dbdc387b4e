{"result": "Aurangabad and Nalanda, both districts located in the south-west alluvial plains, exhibit contrasting agricultural trends. While Nalanda has seen an expansion in its gross cropped area, Aurangabad has experienced a decline. Despite these differences, both districts share a significant characteristic: a considerable portion of their lands in the south-west plains is dedicated to pulse cultivation. This highlights their role in contributing to the pulse production in the region, even as they follow divergent paths in overall agricultural development.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
