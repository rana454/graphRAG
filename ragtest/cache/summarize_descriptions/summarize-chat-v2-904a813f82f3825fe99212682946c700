{"result": "Bihar, a state in India, shares its northern border with Nepal. The geographical proximity of these two regions is significant, especially because rivers originating from Nepal flow into Bihar. This natural course of water from Nepal plays a crucial role in the hydrology of Bihar but also leads to severe floods in the state, impacting its agriculture, infrastructure, and the lives of its residents. The relationship between Bihar and Nepal is thus marked by both geographical closeness and the environmental challenges posed by cross-border river flows.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
