{"result": "The Kosi river, originating from Nepal and entering Bihar, plays a significant role in the state's environmental and economic landscape. It contributes to the water resources available for fisheries in Bihar, providing essential support for the local economy and food supply. However, the Kosi river is also known for its shifting courses, a characteristic that significantly contributes to the flood-prone nature of the region. The river's entry into Bihar from Nepal is a key factor in the state's frequent flood situations, affecting agriculture, infrastructure, and the livelihoods of the local population. Despite the challenges posed by its unpredictable nature, the Kosi river remains a vital part of Bihar's natural resources and ecosystem.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
