{"result": "Katihar and Purnia, both districts located in the eastern plains, are notable for their agricultural productivity and development. They have achieved high yields of arhar, indicating a successful cultivation of this crop. Additionally, these districts have shown notable gains in the area dedicated to summer paddy, reflecting an expansion and improvement in their rice cultivation practices. The relatively high consumption of fertilizer in both Katihar and Purnia suggests a focused approach to agricultural development, aiming to enhance crop yields and farming efficiency.
