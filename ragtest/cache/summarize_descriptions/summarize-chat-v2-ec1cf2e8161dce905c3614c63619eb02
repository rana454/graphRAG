It stands out as a major milk-producing state, although its milk productivity is described as moderate when compared to its significant agricultural outputs. Gujarat has shown a notable rate of increase in the area under sugarcane cultivation, with its sugarcane yield surpassing both the national average and Bihar's yield, indicating its agricultural prowess. During the period of 1983-93, the state witnessed high growth rates in rapeseed/mustard production, further emphasizing its agricultural development. Additionally, Gujarat's infrastructure is well-developed, as evidenced by a much higher percentage of surfaced roads compared to Bihar, facilitating better connectivity and economic activities.\n\nThe state also boasts a high urban population percentage, reflecting its urbanization and economic development. In terms of specific crop yields, Gujarat achieved a high potato yield of 24.98 tonnes/ha during 1990-93, showcasing its efficiency in agricultural production. However, it experienced a decline in the area under wheat during the 1980s, a period during which it was also mentioned in comparison with Bihar regarding wheat cultivation. Despite this, Gujarat has experienced rapid agricultural growth in the past decade, underlining its capacity to adapt and thrive in various agricultural sectors.
