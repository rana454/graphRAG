{"result": "The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is an organization tasked with the procurement of food grains across the country, including rice and wheat, specifically in the state of Bihar. Despite its efforts towards decentralized procurement and the supply of millets, pulses, and other biofortified crops in the region, the FCI faces challenges with ineffective purchase arrangements, leading to lower procurement rates in Bihar compared to other states.
