It is responsible for approving proposals, providing clearances for capital subsidy releases, and simplifying procedures for project approvals and execution, ensuring that projects progress smoothly and efficiently. Additionally, the PMC is tasked with overseeing activities, providing direction, and monitoring the progress of the guidelines to guarantee that projects adhere to established standards and objectives. Beyond these responsibilities, the PMC also functions as a Project Management Consultant in the grievance redressal process. At Level 2, it is tasked with resolving grievances within one month if these issues remain unresolved at Level 1 or if the investor is unsatisfied with the initial handling.
