{"result": "Small millets are cereal crops that have experienced a notable increase in yield over time. Initially, they matched the yield growth rate of ragi at 2.67% per annum. However, they saw a significant increase in yield, peaking at 4.27% in the second sub-period. This demonstrates the substantial growth and improvement in the cultivation and production of small millets over the observed periods.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
