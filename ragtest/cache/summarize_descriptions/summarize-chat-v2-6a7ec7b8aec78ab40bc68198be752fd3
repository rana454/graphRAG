{"result": "The State, as referred to in the context, encompasses a larger administrative area notable for its districts and evolving irrigation patterns. It is currently undergoing significant changes in its agricultural landscape, characterized by a trend of increasing operational holdings alongside a decreasing net sown area. This shift is resulting in the emergence of non-viable marginal farms, highlighting a pressing need for land consolidation and strategies to address absentee cultivation issues.
