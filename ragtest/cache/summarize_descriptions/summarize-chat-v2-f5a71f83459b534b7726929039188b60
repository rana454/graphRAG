{"result": "Fruits, as part of Bihar's agricultural output, are included in the Gross Value of Output from Agriculture. However, they experienced a decrease in their share from the fiscal year ending in March 2003 (TE 2002-03) to the fiscal year ending in March 2014 (TE 2013-14). Despite this decline, fruits have been suggested as an alternative agricultural focus to diversify Bihar's production systems and improve nutritional outcomes. This recommendation indicates a potential shift towards prioritizing fruit cultivation to enhance both the economic and health aspects of the region's agricultural sector.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
