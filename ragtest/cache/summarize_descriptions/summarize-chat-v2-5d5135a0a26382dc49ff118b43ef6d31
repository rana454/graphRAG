{"result": "The net sown area in Bihar, which represents the area actually sown with crops, is 56.03 lakh hectares. This figure indicates the extent of land that is directly utilized for agricultural purposes. However, the net sown area has been experiencing a decline at a rate of -0.79% per annum. This decrease can be attributed to various factors, including the conversion of agricultural land to current fallow and non-agricultural uses. Furthermore, there has been a noticeable reduction in the proportion of land sown with crops in Bihar, which declined from 60.6% to 57.2% between the triennium ending (TE) 2003-04 and TE 2012-13. This trend underscores the challenges facing agricultural land use in the region, highlighting the need for strategies to mitigate the reduction in net sown area.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
