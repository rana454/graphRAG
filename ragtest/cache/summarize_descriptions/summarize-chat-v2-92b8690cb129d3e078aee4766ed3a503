{"result": "The State Investment Promotion Board (SIPB) and the Project Monitoring Committee (PMC) are two entities that work in tandem to facilitate and oversee investment projects. The SIPB is responsible for approving projects, which are then scrutinized by the PMC to determine their eligibility for subsidies under the Bihar Industrial Investment Promotion Policy (BIIPP), 2016. Once a project has been approved by the SIPB and deemed eligible for subsidies by the PMC, the PMC undertakes the responsibility of sanctioning and disbursing these subsidies. This collaborative process ensures that investment projects are thoroughly evaluated and supported, promoting industrial growth and investment in the region.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
