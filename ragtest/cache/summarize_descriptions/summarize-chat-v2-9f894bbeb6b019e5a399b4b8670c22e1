However, its utilization within the state is characterized by both low application rates and an imbalance in its use. Fertilizer encompasses any substance that is employed to boost plant growth. The manufacture, import, sale, and distribution of fertilizers are governed by specific regulatory standards to ensure their effectiveness and safety. This regulatory framework ensures that fertilizers meet certain criteria before they can be used in agricultural practices, aiming to optimize their benefits while minimizing potential negative impacts on the environment and human health.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
