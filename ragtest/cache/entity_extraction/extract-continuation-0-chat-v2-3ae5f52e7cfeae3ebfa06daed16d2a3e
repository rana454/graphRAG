The policy will support building an enabling environment for the promotion of sustainable Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) in Bihar and will support FPOs, promoting organizations, and other stakeholders in addressing various challenges faced by them. The proposed policy for the promotion of the FPO ecosystem in Bihar has been included in the DPR for promotion of the FPO ecosystem in Bihar.\nTo streamline the efforts for the overall development of the FPO ecosystem in the state, Bihar Small Farmers Agribusiness Consortium (BSFAC) under the Department of Agriculture shall work as the nodal agency in the state. BSFAC will undertake initiatives to support FPOs, promoting organizations, and other stakeholders to support them in addressing their challenges.\nCapacity-building exercises such as residential training, certificate courses, short-duration trainings, and exposure visits to best-performing FPOs will be undertaken. These initiatives will enhance the capacity of FPO Board members, lead farmers, accountants, and other staff of FPOs. To streamline training and capacity-building initiatives, BAMETI shall be designated as the dedicated State Level training institution for FPOs.\nFPOs in Bihar are mostly in the early stages of business development and often face difficulties in accessing institutional finance at affordable rates. Schemes will be formulated to provide seed fund/initial capital to nascent FPOs. The scheme will be used to build a corpus with financial institutions for lending to FPOs in Bihar at a concessional rate of interest. In addition to this, the government will also facilitate the setting up and operationalization of a blended revolving corpus fund with eligible financial institutions to provide low-interest rate working capital assistance to FPOs.\nTo support FPOs in the marketing of agricultural produce, BSFAC shall organize buyer-seller meetings/tie-ups to promote FPOs' engagement/tie-ups with various procurement companies, traders, exporters, and other stakeholders. These events will help in generating more business, meeting national and international buyers, forging new strategic partnerships, and gaining industry knowledge.\nThe initiatives will help in the development of financially viable and sustainable Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) in the state of Bihar, thereby increasing the incomes of farmers by providing an enabling ecosystem for leveraging the economies of scale.\nPromotion of Agri-Exports from Bihar\nThe rising growth in agriculture and allied sectors in Bihar offers ample scope and opportunity for entering global value chains to earn foreign exchange and enable producers to earn higher prices for their farm produce. With more than 70% of the population of Bihar engaged in the agriculture sector, linking the production in these sectors to the export markets is one of the best ways to stimulate growth and thereby expand the farmers' markets substantially, enhancing income opportunities for producers.\nExport orientation of the agriculture sector coupled with quality produce, sizeable processing industry, and strong domestic market are some of the prerequisites for harnessing the true export potential of Bihar. The Government of Bihar has prepared a comprehensive policy to encourage and promote the exports of agriculture and allied sector products from Bihar. The policy will create an enabling environment for export promotion and will enhance the level of processing, storage, reducing post-harvest losses, value addition, and trade facilitation, thereby generating higher income returns for farmers and contributing to India's vision of increasing agricultural exports.\nBihar is a landlocked state and its exporters are competitively disadvantaged against states that have sea coasts and an international airport. Exporters of horticultural produce such as fruits, vegetables, and flowers also face significant risk of quality deterioration. To make the exports from Bihar price competitive with other states, the government will bring a comprehensive freight assistance scheme for exporters of agricultural products. Exports of fresh horticultural produce (fruits, vegetables, flowers) will also be incentivized in the form of packaging assistance.\nThe insistence on quality of agricultural/food products being imported in high-value markets across the globe is a major concern for exporters due to stringent quality norms. To meet such stringent norms, processors/manufacturers will be encouraged for implementation and certification of Food Safety Management Systems. The Government of Bihar shall provide assistance to exporters/processing units to implement certifications such as ISO, HACCP, TQM, KOSHER, etc.\nAggressive market access and market penetration are required to increase the share of exports from Bihar to newer markets. The government will undertake targeted promotional activities including participation in international exhibitions, organizing fairs, in-store marketing, brand promotion, etc., and shall organize aggressive international marketing and branding of local ethnic and GI products to gain the market advantage for such products.\nThe proposed initiatives will encourage and promote the exports of agriculture and allied sector products from Bihar by creating an enabling environment for the export of agricultural commodities. It will also enhance the level of value addition in the state, leading to higher prices for agricultural products and thereby generating higher income for farmers.\nOther Initiatives\n* The department will implement the agricultural marketing policies/programmes/schemes of both state and central government for the integrated development of marketing of agricultural and other allied produce in the state. It will coordinate with various agencies to increase the market access of farmers and safeguard the interests of farmers.\n* The department shall facilitate the development of export-enabling infrastructures such as integrated pack houses, centers for perishable cargo, cold chains, food processing industries, common facility centers, NABL accredited laboratory labs, etc., in convergence by leveraging the benefits/incentives already being provided under the various policies/schemes of the Government of Bihar, Government of India, and other central/state government agencies.\n* The department shall coordinate and leverage support\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India focusing on the development of the FPO ecosystem and promotion of agri-exports)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The state government responsible for the development of policies to support FPOs and promote agricultural exports)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR SMALL FARMERS AGRIBUSINESS CONSORTIUM (BSFAC)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Nodal agency under the Department of Agriculture in Bihar working to support FPOs and their development)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAMETI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>State Level training institution designated for FPOs in Bihar for capacity-building exercises)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FPO ECOSYSTEM<|>EVENT<|>The network and environment in Bihar for the development and support of Farmer Producer Organizations)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR<|>FPO ECOSYSTEM<|>The Government of Bihar has prepared policies for the development of the FPO ecosystem<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR SMALL FARMERS AGRIBUSINESS CONSORTIUM (BSFAC)<|>FPO ECOSYSTEM<|>BSFAC is the nodal agency working for the development of the FPO ecosystem in Bihar<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BAMETI<|>FPO ECOSYSTEM<|>BAMETI is designated for training and capacity building within the FPO ecosystem<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR<|>BIHAR SMALL FARMERS AGRIBUSINESS CONSORTIUM (BSFAC)<|>BSFAC operates under the Department of Agriculture as per the Government of Bihar's directive<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR<|>BAMETI<|>BAMETI is designated by the Government of Bihar for FPO training and capacity building<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
