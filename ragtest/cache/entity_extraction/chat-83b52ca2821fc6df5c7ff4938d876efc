However, the dependence on diesel pumps for irrigation is high, which increases the cost of cultivation. The state has abundant groundwater resources, but the development and utilization of these resources are limited due to the high cost of diesel and the lack of electricity.\nMarket access is another area where Bihar lags behind. The state has only 147 regulated markets, which is inadequate to cater to the needs of its large agricultural population. The density of markets in Bihar is one of the lowest in the country, with one market serving 3,000 square kilometers, compared to the national average of 435 square kilometers. The lack of market access affects the price realization for farmers, leading to lower incomes.\n5.2 Drivers of Agricultural Growth\nThe econometric analysis of the drivers of agricultural growth in Bihar reveals that infrastructure development, especially roads and electricity, has a significant positive impact on agricultural productivity. The availability of credit and extension services also plays a crucial role in enhancing agricultural growth. The study found that the growth of non-farm income, particularly from wage labor and migration, has a positive effect on agricultural productivity, as it provides additional income for farmers to invest in agriculture.\nThe recurrent spells of deficient rains  in recent years  have caused a decline in groundwater \nlevels in certain parts of the state. Figure 3  shows the comparative picture of the level of \nground water district -wise in 2012 a nd 2015 after the monsoon. It is seen that the ground \nwater level has been declining in south Bihar and in certain pockets in north Bihar as well.  \nFigure 3: Status of Groundwater water level in Bihar  \n \n \nThe bifurcation of Bihar in 2000-01 significantly altered its geographical landscape. Originally, Bihar encompassed 17.4 million hectares, but 8.0 million hectares were allocated to Jharkhand, leaving Bihar with 9.4 million hectares. Over the years, the land use pattern in Bihar has remained relatively stable, with minimal changes in areas such as forests and non-cultivating lands. However, there has been a notable decline in the net sown area from 60.6% to 57.2% between TE 2003-04 and TE 2012-13, accompanied by an increase in fallow land, primarily due to waterlogging issues.\n\nThe decline in net sown area has led to a reduction in the gross cropped area by 0.4 million hectares or nearly 5% during the same period. The scarcity of land for agricultural purposes in Bihar is further highlighted by the fact that the gross cropped area per 100 persons in the state is only 7.2 hectares, much lower than states like Madhya Pradesh and Punjab.\n\nBihar's cropping pattern is predominantly focused on cereals, which account for about 79% of the gross cropped area, significantly higher than the national average of 51%. Rice and wheat dominate this sector, with rice being the primary kharif crop and wheat the key rabi crop. While the share of rice in the gross cropped area has declined, the acreage of wheat and maize has increased.\n\nAgricultural growth in Bihar has been impressive in recent years, with the state recording a growth rate of 4.7% between 2005-06 and 2014-15, surpassing the national average of 3.6%. The agricultural GDP in Bihar has seen fluctuations, but the average annual growth rate reached 7.1% in the last five years of the period.\n\nThe composition of Bihar's agriculture sector has also evolved. The share of livestock in the Gross Value of Output from Agriculture and Allied Activities (GVOA) increased from 24% in 2000-01 to 33% in 2013-14, while the contribution of food grains and horticulture declined. Milk has emerged as a significant driver of agricultural growth in Bihar.\n\nDespite the challenges, Bihar has shown resilience and growth in its agricultural sector, particularly in the production of cereals like rice and wheat, and cash crops such as maize and sugarcane. However, issues like waterlogging, limited access to irrigation, and low adoption of high-yielding varieties continue to impact productivity.\n\nFruits and Vegetables Segment\n\nThe share of fruits and vegetables in Bihar's Gross Value of Output from Agriculture (GVOA) decreased from 30% in the triennium ending (TE) 2002-03 to 20% in TE 2013-14. However, in absolute terms, the output value of fruits and vegetables grew significantly from ₹81.6 billion to ₹172.4 billion during the same period. Vegetables dominate this segment, with the state dedicating around 11% of its gross cropped area (GCA) to vegetable production, far exceeding the national average of 5.0%. In TE 2013-14, Bihar was the third-largest vegetable producer in India, accounting for 8.9% of the total, trailing only West Bengal (14.9%) and Uttar Pradesh (11.8%). Potato is the most important vegetable crop in Bihar, occupying around 38% of the state's vegetable area. Other major vegetables include cauliflower, okra, brinjal, onion, tomato, and cabbage.\n\nBihar is also the third-largest potato producer in India, after Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. In TE 2013-14, potato yield in Bihar was 20.2 MT per hectare, compared to the all-India average of 21.9 MT per hectare. The state’s productivity in vegetables like okra, brinjal, onion, and tomato is higher than the national average, although it lags in crops like cauliflower and\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
