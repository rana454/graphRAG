The period from 1970-71 to 1992-93 is considered for the analysis. Analysis of area shift was made first for the crop groups and then for the major crops. Crop groups were classified as superior and coarse cereals among the cereal crops, total pulses, fruits and vegetables, oilseeds, fibers, spices, and miscellaneous crops. The percentage share of these crop groups in the gross cropped area was worked out for different years and the trend growth rate was obtained to determine the direction and rate of shift. Similarly, for major crops, the percentage share in respective crop groups during the year under reference was worked out and the trend growth rate on this was obtained to assess the direction of area shifts across major crops.\n1.15 Method to Study Land Use Pattern\nThe land use pattern was studied for the period from 1951-91 at the State level. At the zone/district level, the period 1979-91 was considered, as the required data was available for that period only. Classification of land use, as adopted by the Directorate of Economics and Statistics, Government of Bihar, was used for the analysis. Trend growth rates using log-linear function were worked out for various categories of land use at the state/zone/district level for the period under reference.\n1.16 Method to Study Expansion in the Use of Modern Inputs\nOf the several modern inputs, three major ones—fertilizer, irrigation, and HYV seeds—were considered for detailed study, as it was in respect of these modern inputs that the required data were available. Moreover, these are the major constituents of modern inputs in physical terms.\n\n1.17 Expansion in Fertilizer Consumption\nExpansion in fertilizer consumption was first studied in terms of its physical volume expressed in the form of per hectare of gross cropped area at the state/zone/district level. The period under consideration was 1971-93 at the state level and 1977-91 at the zone/district level. In the second stage, the trend growth rate was worked out on this data to determine the direction and rate of change.\n1.18 Composition of Fertilizer Consumption\nThe composition of fertilizer consumption was studied by working out the shares of different fertilizer nutrients, i.e., NPK, at two points of time to examine whether there was balanced consumption of fertilizer in the State and in what direction it was moving across different zones/districts. To further supplement the measure of imbalance in fertilizer consumption, the index of nutrient ratio was worked out for different zones/districts.\n1.19 Elasticity of Nutrient Ratio\nTo better comprehend the question of how the unbalanced use of fertilizer influences the yield of foodgrains, the elasticity of the index of nutrient ratio with respect to foodgrains yield for different zones/districts was worked out.\n1.20 Elasticity of Fertilizer Consumption\nElasticity of fertilizer consumption with respect to foodgrains production, irrigation, and rainfall was also worked out.\n1.21 Elasticity of Irrigation\nSimilarly, the elasticity of irrigation with respect to the yield of foodgrains, fertilizer consumption, crop intensity, and crop diversification was also worked out.\n1.22 Relationship of HYV Area\nThe relationship of HYV area with irrigation and fertilizer consumption at the state/zone/district level was also worked out following a simple regression equation considering the period from 1976-77 to 1990-91.\nChapter Scheme\n1.23 Based on the analysis thus made, the present study is presented in twelve chapters:\nIntroduction\nProfile of the State\nGrowth Performance of Foodgrains in Bihar - Temporal and District-wise Analysis\nGrowth Performance of Major Crops - Temporal and District-wise Analysis\nAnalysis of Cropping Pattern and Area Shift Across Major Crops\nYield Expansion: Crop-wise Comparative Analysis\nTrend and Pattern of Growth in Land Use - Zone/District-wise Analysis\nGrowth in Fertilizer Consumption\nGrowth in Irrigation\nExpansion in the Use of HYV Seeds\nFlow of Institutional Credit\nOperational Holdings and Tenancy Status\n\nCHAPTER II\nPROFILE OF THE STATE\nThe state of Bihar is stretched between 27°-31° and 20°-58° North Latitude and 88°-18° and 83°-20\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
