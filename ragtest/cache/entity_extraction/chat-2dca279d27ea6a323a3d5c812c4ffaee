It was 38.35 t/ha. in 1970-71 but declined thereafter to a level of 27.23 t/ha. in 1978-79. It maintained static condition till 1986-87 but showed a sharp increase in 1987-88 with yield level at 38.01 t/ha and further reaching a maximum of 53.72 t/ha. in 1989-90, but declined again to 45.39 t/ha. in 1992-93. The trend rate of growth was increasing annually at 1.04% only during 1971-93. Between the two sub-periods, it showed a declining trend at (-)1.48% in the first sub-period and an increasing trend at 6.02% in the second sub-period.\nIV.7.13 Yield Comparison\nThe yield of sugarcane in Bihar was dismally low (45.10 t/ha. in 1990-93) compared to the national average (65.09 t/ha.) as well as states like Maharashtra (80.92 t/ha.), Tamil Nadu (103.13 t/ha.), Gujarat (86.75 t/ha.), Karnataka (82.51 t/ha.), and Uttar Pradesh (56.24 t/ha.).\nIV.7.14 Regional Pattern\nAcross different zones, the yield was relatively high in the north-west plains (52.54 t/ha.) and low in the plateau districts (26.51 t/ha.). In the east and the south-west zones, it was almost similar at 41.66 t/ha. and 40.30 t/ha. respectively. Districts with high production of sugarcane were found to have high yield of sugarcane. They included East Champaran (53.04 t/ha.), Gopalganj (59.26 t/ha.), and West Champaran (53.10 t/ha.). In Siwan and Vaishali, although production of sugarcane was much less, its yield was fairly high at 53.92 t/ha. and 52.83 t/ha. respectively. Among the districts of other zones, the yield of sugarcane was found to be fairly high in Saharsa (52.95 t/ha.), Nawadah (46.76 t/ha.), Gaya (45.03 t/ha.), Singhbhum (51.14 t/ha.), and Santhal Parganas (46.14 t/ha.).\nIV.7.15 Trend Rates of Growth in Yield\nAnalyzing the trend rates of growth in the yield of sugarcane for various agro-climatic zones and districts during 1977-91, it is observed that zones of north-west alluvial plains, east alluvial plains, and south-west alluvial plains showed increasing trends in yield at 2.01%, 1.08%, and 2.98% respectively. The plateau region, however, showed a declining trend at (-)2.02%. Analysis of trend rates of growth in two sub-periods suggests that the north-west alluvial plains gained significantly in yield by reversing the declining trend (-0.93%) in the first sub-period to an increasing trend (6.10%) in the second sub-period. Similar trends were observed in the east alluvial plains and the south-west alluvial plains with reversals to increasing trends at 10.07% and 4.90% respectively in the second sub-period. The plateau region continued to show a declining trend (-2.28%) even in the second sub-period. The major sugarcane growing districts such as West Champaran, East Champaran, and Gopalganj showed high growth rates in the yield of sugarcane during the second sub-period. In some of the less dominant sugarcane growing districts, however, the rate of growth in the yield of sugarcane was still more impressive. Such districts included Bhagalpur (17.98%), Munger (14.60%), and Saharsa (10.50%).\nConclusions\nIV.7.16 Summary\nThe following are the broad conclusions with regard to the trend and pattern of growth of sugarcane in Bihar:\nBihar was one of the major sugarcane growing states in the country. However, this status slipped from the State in the early eighties. It was nowhere near Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu in terms of area as well as yield of sugarcane. The second sub-period witnessed a revival in sugarcane production in an upward direction. This emanated from both area expansion and yield increase. The rate of increase in yield was more impressive.\nSugarcane production was also region-specific in Bihar, with the north-west plains contributing almost four-fifths of the State's production. Among the districts of the zone, West Champaran, East Champaran, and Gopalganj, all forming a geographical cluster, excelled in sugarcane production.\nAll these districts showed a significant increase in sugarcane production, especially during the second sub-period, due largely to yield increase.\nThe resurrection in sugarcane production is also seen in other districts of the zone such as Madhubani, Muzaffarpur, Siwan, and Samastipur, which were traditionally sugarcane-growing districts.\nRegional Pattern\nIV.8.3 Jute Cultivation\nJute was a region-specific crop in Bihar, primarily cultivated in districts within the east alluvial plains. In other agro-climatic zones, jute cultivation was virtually absent. Of the total jute production in the state, 98.83% was produced in the east plains alone. Among the districts\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
