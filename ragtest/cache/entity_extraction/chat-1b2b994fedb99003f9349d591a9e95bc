The declining trend became sharp in respect of the north-west alluvial plains from (-0.10%) in the first sub-period to (-4.21%) in the second sub-period. Declining trend continued to be sharp at (-2.96%) during the second sub-period as against (-2.82%) during the first sub-period in respect of the east plains. In the case of the south-west plains, it reversed to a declining trend at (-0.56%) in the second sub-period from an increasing trend at 0.49% during the first sub-period. The growth rate further decelerated from (-0.90%) in the first sub-period to (-2.12%) in the second sub-period in the plateau zone. Across different districts, the rate of growth in gram production was relatively high in:\nDarbhanga (2.69%)\nAurangabad (4.39%)\nNawadah (4.59%)\nMajor gram growing districts such as Palamu, Santhal Parganas, and Rohtas showed a reversal in the growth rate of gram output.\nIV.5.4 Instability Analysis\nThe production of gram in the State was observed to decline with a coefficient of variation at 9.87% only. Across different zones, the south-west plains alone showed a stable increase in gram production with a coefficient of variation at 12.95% only. However, in respect of the plateau districts, the declining trend in gram production showed high fluctuation, as the coefficient of variation was high at 25.99%. On the other hand, the declining trend in respect of the north-west and the east plains was more stable with a coefficient of variation at 15.66% and 12.55%, respectively. Across major gram growing districts, the increasing trend was more stable in Patna with a coefficient of variation at 13.96% only. But it was relatively more unstable in the case of Bhojpur (24.17%) and Rohtas (20.59%). In Palamu and Darbhanga, the rate of increase was not stable, as the coefficient of variation was high at 42.40% and 37.24%, respectively. Bhagalpur too was a major gram growing district. In its case, however, the production of gram showed a declining trend (-1.19%) with low fluctuation, as the coefficient of variation was 12.80% only.\nIV.5.5 Analysis of Acceleration/Deceleration\nThe declining trend in gram production of the State was observed to be decelerating (-0.06%). The increasing trend in the south-west plains was found to decelerate (-0.03%). The declining trend in respect of the north-west (-0.22%), east plains (-0.08%), and plateau districts (-0.05%) was also decelerating. Among the major gram growing districts, the increasing trend was found to be accelerating only in:\nPatna (0.65%)\nPalamu (0.92%)\nDarbhanga (0.51%)\nIn the case of Bhojpur (-0.23%) and Rohtas (-0.25%), the increasing trend was observed to be decelerating. In Bhagalpur, the declining trend was found to be decelerating (-0.24%).\nIV.5.6 Area under Gram\nThe area under gram showed a sharp shrinkage in the state. It was as high as 244.40 thousand hectares in 1970-71, which increased initially to 266.60 thousand hectares in 1972-73, but continued to decline thereafter, reaching the lowest level at 124.30 thousand hectares in 1992-93, with an index number at 51 points only. The trend growth rate was observed to be declining at (-2.40%) per annum during 1971-93. The rate of decline was almost uniform in both sub-periods. It was (-2.59%) in the first sub-period and (-2.40%) in the second sub-period.\nIV.5.7 Inter-State Comparison\nInter-state comparison of area under gram suggests that Bihar was way behind other states, holding the seventh position in the country. While it occupied 2333.43 thousand ha in Madhya Pradesh and 1376.80 thousand ha in Rajasthan, it was a mere 146.90 thousand ha in Bihar during 1990-93. It formed only 2.25% of the gram area of the country. Comparing the trend rates of growth with major gram growing states, it is observed that the rate of decline in area was relatively low in Bihar. For example, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, the major gram growing states, showed expansion in gram area at 1.18%, 2.50%, and 4.01% per annum during 1983-93. Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Haryana, on the other hand, showed shrinkage in gram area at (-2.89%), (-1.73%), and (-5.22%) per annum, respectively, as against (-2.37%) in Bihar during the same period.\nIV.5.8 Regional Pattern\nIn terms of area, the south-west plains dominated with a share of 54.17% in the State gram area. Districts with relatively high area under gram included:\nSouth-West Plains: Bhojpur (11.79%), Patna (10.23%), and Rohtas (13.35%)\nPlateau: Palamu (7.39%) and Santhal Parganas (3.14%)\nEast: Mun\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
