Meat production in the state increased by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.7% between 2001-02 and 2013-14, which is significantly lower than the national average of 9.5%. Consequently, Bihar's share in India's total meat production dropped from 8.3% in the early 2000s to 4.2% by 2013-14. Currently, Bihar is the eighth largest meat-producing state, following Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, and Kerala.\n\nMutton constitutes the largest share of meat production in Bihar at 22.5%, followed by pork at 20.5%, and buffalo meat at 15.2%. Poultry meat accounts for only 12.2% of total meat production as of 2012-13. However, poultry has shown the fastest growth rate among meat types, driven by the expansion of poultry farms and hatcheries, contrasting with a decline in backyard poultry. From 2007 to 2012, the number of poultry birds in broiler farms increased from 3.1 million to 5.1 million, reflecting a CAGR of 7.8%, surpassing the national average of 6.3%.\n\nIn terms of specific meat types, Bihar contributed 7% of India's mutton production in 2012-13, ranking as the fifth-largest producer. It is the second-largest pork producer, with 13.2% of India's total pig meat production. For buffalo meat, Bihar ranks sixth in the country, contributing 4% to national production.\n\nDespite plans under the Agricultural Roadmap (ARM-II) to boost meat production through goat distribution, establishment of feed factories, modern slaughterhouses, and chick distribution programs, only the chick distribution initiative, implemented through the Jeevika program, saw any significant progress due to funding shortages.\n\nFishery Segment\n\nBihar is endowed with rich aquatic resources, including approximately 3,200 km of rivers, 100,000 hectares of chaurs and floodplains, 9,000 hectares of oxbow lakes, 7,200 hectares of reservoirs, and 6,900 hectares of ponds and tanks. Despite these resources, the fishery sector contributes only about 5.2% of the total agricultural output. The state's fish production does not meet its demand, positioning Bihar as the ninth-largest fish-producing state in India.\n\nAs a landlocked state, Bihar's fishery depends entirely on inland resources. In 2013-14, the state produced about 0.43 million tonnes of fish, representing 4.3% of India's total fish production. This increased to 0.48 million tonnes in 2014-15, showing an 11% year-on-year growth.\n\nA 2008 ICAR report identified significant potential for expanding inland fishery, particularly in ponds and oxbow lakes. The report suggested interventions like clearing weed infestations, renovating ponds, establishing brood banks and hatcheries, and leasing water bodies for fish production. Some of these recommendations were incorporated into ARM-II, which proposed fingerling rearing by farmers, construction of large rearing ponds, and leasing ponds for long-term development. Additionally, ARM-II planned to establish feed mills, wholesale and retail outlets, refrigerated vans, cold storage, and ice plants at the district level, alongside training for farmers and extension workers.\n\nThis section provides a detailed analysis of the impact of floods on agriculture in Bihar, the state's approach to flood protection, and challenges in the energy and infrastructure sectors affecting agriculture.\n\n5.1.2 Floods and Flood Protection\nAgriculture in Bihar has been highly vulnerable to floods and droughts, with significant contractions in agricultural growth during years of severe floods (e.g., 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2007, 2008, 2013) or droughts (e.g., 2005, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2012). The primary strategy for flood protection has been the construction of embankments, which, by 2012-13, extended to 3,732 km and protected 3.6 million hectares (52.8% of flood-affected areas). A target was set to increase this to 81.2% by constructing an additional 1,555.7 km of embankments by 2017. However, the state has recently shifted focus from embankments to rehabilitating natural drainage systems and allowing rivers more space to flow. The limitations of embankments include blocking the beneficial alluvial sediments, raising riverbeds, and the risk of embankment breaches, leading experts to consider upstream reservoir storage in the Himalayas. However, the feasibility of such storage for flood control is limited, and environmental concerns make large dam construction in the fragile Himalayan ecosystem challenging.\n\n5.1.3 Energy for Agriculture\nBihar faces chronic power deficiencies, with per capita power consumption at only 144 kWh, compared to the national average of 927 kWh. In 2013-14, the state generated only 94 MW and imported 2,241 MW. Agriculture's share of total power sales has decreased from 13.1% in 2009-10 to 6.1% in 2012-13, reflecting poor infrastructure and low electricity usage in agriculture, with only 62 kWh/ha, compared to over 1,000 kWh/ha in more advanced states. The state relies heavily on diesel for irrigation, driving up costs and reducing profitability.
