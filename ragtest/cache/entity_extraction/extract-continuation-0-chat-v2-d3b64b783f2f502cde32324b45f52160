In a densely populated region like Bihar, it is difficult to increase the area under forests. But it can be compensated by making alternative arrangements and using all the empty lands of the State. Under the already launched Kishore Chetna Vriksh Yojna, awareness about the environment, especially about trees, is sought to be created among the school students and their participation is being ensured in the afforestation programmes.\n2.9 Animal Husbandry\nBihar’s livestock sector is crucial not only in terms of its contribution to rural income but also for the section of the population to which this income goes. Bihar’s livestock sector accounted for approximately one-quarter of the total value of agricultural output in TE 2002-03. Livestock activity is concentrated among landless households and those with marginal holdings of less than 1 hectare of land. Approximately 35 percent of rural households in Bihar report owning cattle, 20 percent buffalo, and 15 percent sheep and goats (NSSO 2003). Of all rural households owning cattle and/or buffalo in Bihar, more than three-quarters are either landless or have less than 1 hectare of land. Sheep and goats tend to be even more concentrated among landless and marginal rural households.\nMilk is the most important livestock product, accounting for approximately 50 percent of the total livestock output, followed by meat (24 percent) and other livestock products. Milk production in Bihar has grown by around 92 percent over the period 2001-2006, while meat production has grown by only 12 percent over the same period. Similarly, egg production has increased by 35 percent over this period, while wool production has fallen by almost 50 percent (Table 2.25). According to the 2003 livestock census, there were approximately 10 million heads of cattle in Bihar, only 10 percent of which were cross-bred, which explains the low productivity and growth of livestock output in the State. The fact that the number of institutions providing extension services to the livestock sector has remained stagnant over the years has certainly not helped its productivity scenario (Table 2.26).\n2.10 Fisheries and Poultry\nThere has been a steady increase in fish production in the State over the period 2001-02 to 2005-06 and its share in total agricultural GDP has nearly doubled in the last 10 years. However, its production is estimated to fall to 160 thousand MT in 2006-07 (Table 2.27) because seed has substantially fallen this year. Fishermen in the State are being trained to increase the productivity of the fisheries sector, and loans are being granted for maintenance and renovation of privately owned ponds in the State.\n2.11 Agricultural Mechanisation\nThe current level of mechanization of agriculture in the State is very low. While there are only 17 tractors per hectare in the State, the figure for Punjab is 68 tractors per hectare. At present, Bihar has 111,672 tractors, 4,000 power tillers, 2.5 lakh stonery engines, 66,128 mould board ploughs, 50,000 cultivators, 15,000 seed drills, 290,000 sprayers, and 300,000 threshers. While recommended electricity consumption for farming is 2 KW/hect, it is only 0.8 KW/hect in Bihar due to limited availability of electricity. The Government is accordingly promoting agricultural mechanization on a large scale through the provision of grants for small tractors, power tillers, threshers, and GISE tillage machines.\n2.12 Land and Agricultural Reforms\nThe available data for landholdings demonstrate the extent of inequality in the agrarian structure. For example, more than 80 percent of operational holdings in Bihar are marginal (below one hectare), and they account for only 36 percent of the total operational land area. At the other end, medium and large operational holdings of more than four hectares comprise less than 2.5 percent of all holdings but constitute over 20 percent of operational land area. In Bihar, the incidence of landlessness has increased in the decade of the nineties from 9 percent to 10 percent of the rural households, and the proportion of households in the marginal segment has also increased significantly in the same time period (Table 2.28).\nApart from the widening of disparity in land distribution, it can also be observed that while the incidence of poverty has declined for all landowning classes during the nineties, it has actually increased for the landless from 51 percent to 56 percent, strongly suggesting that land ownership is clearly associated with poverty. At the end of the nineties, therefore, the share of land-poor households in the total poor population has increased—from 12 to 14 percent for landless households and from 55 to 61 percent for marginal landholding households.\nIt is in this backdrop that the State government has constituted the Land Reforms Commission in June 2006 to look into the issues of land ceiling, land consolidation, and occupancy/tenancy rights. It also has been mandated to analyze the rural turmoil in the backdrop of land-related disputes and recommend remedial measures accordingly. The Commission is to look into the feasibility and impact of cooperative farming, giving due importance to the rights and concerns of the small and marginal farmers.\nPolicy Initiatives\nThe New Agricultural Policy was made by the State government in 2006 to build upon the natural advantages that the State has in agriculture. Its fertile land, huge water resources, and conducive climatic conditions imply tremendous potential for the agricultural sector. Despite this, productivity of crops in Bihar compares poorly with other states. Thus, at the core of the new agricultural policy for Bihar is the focus on increasing productivity of crops, not merely\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A densely populated region in India facing challenges in increasing forest area due to limited land availability, significant in livestock and agricultural sectors)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KISHORE CHETNA VRIKSH YOJNA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A program launched to create environmental awareness among school students and involve them in afforestation programs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NSSO 2003<|>ORGANIZATION<|>National Sample Survey Office's survey in 2003 providing data on livestock ownership among rural households in Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAND REFORMS COMMISSION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Commission constituted by the State government in June 2006 to address issues related to land ceiling, consolidation, and tenancy rights)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW AGRICULTURAL POLICY<|>EVENT<|>Policy initiative made by the State government in 2006 focusing on increasing agricultural productivity in Bihar)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>KISHORE CHETNA VRIKSH YOJNA<|>Kishore Chetna Vriksh Yojna is an environmental initiative taking place in Bihar<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>NSSO 2003<|>NSSO 2003 provides statistical data on livestock ownership in Bihar<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>LAND REFORMS COMMISSION<|>The Land Reforms Commission was established by the State government of Bihar to address land-related issues<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>NEW AGRICULTURAL POLICY<|>The New Agricultural Policy was created by the State government to improve agricultural productivity in Bihar<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
