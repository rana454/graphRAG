The decline was as high as (-11.07%) in the plateau districts and as low as (-0.21%) in the south-west alluvial plains. The second sub-period brought a reversal in the positive direction in all zones, except the north-west alluvial plains which continued to experience a declining trend at an accelerated rate even during this period. The rate of decline in this zone was (-0.21%) in the first sub-period, but increased to (-2.10%) in the second sub-period. In other zones, the rate of increase in production of rapeseed/mustard was impressive. For example, in the north-west alluvial plains, it reversed from a declining trend at (-6.07%) in the first sub-period to an increasing trend at 8.03% in the second sub-period. In the plateau region, it reversed from a high rate of decline at (-11.09%) in the first sub-period to a low rate of decline at (-0.13%) in the second sub-period, and in the east alluvial plains, from a declining trend at (-0.47%) in the first sub-period to an increasing trend at 4.05% in the second sub-period.\nIV.6.6 Rate of Growth in Rapeseed/Mustard Production\nA large number of districts showed relatively high rates of growth in rapeseed/mustard production during 1977-91. They included Darbhanga (7.36%), Samastipur (8.31%), Siwan (10.20%), Vaishali (5.96%), Begusarai (15.85%), Bhagalpur (4.92%), Aurangabad (6.34%), Patna (7.66%), and Rohtas (11.88%).\nIV.6.7 Instability in Rapeseed/Mustard Production\nRapeseed/mustard production during 1977-91 in the State showed stable increase, as the coefficient of variation was low at 15.14% only. Across different zones, the increasing trend rate of growth was more stable in the north-west plains with a coefficient of variation at 19.79% only. On the other hand, the increasing trend in respect of the east plains, the major rapeseed/mustard growing zone, was relatively more unstable, as the coefficient of variation was high at 25.71%. In the case of the south-west plains (31.72%) and plateau districts (22.48%), the increasing trend rate of growth was unstable. Districts with higher growth rates in rapeseed/mustard production showed higher levels of instability. For example, Begusarai, Purnea, and Saharsa with high trend rates of growth showed high coefficients of variation, ranging between 57.34% and 95.12%. Similar was the pattern in respect of other districts showing high rates of growth in rapeseed/mustard production.\nIV.6 Rapeseed/Mustard\nIV.6.8 Acceleration/Deceleration in Growth\nState Level: The rate of growth in rapeseed/mustard production showed a slight acceleration at 0.40% per annum.\nZones:\nSouth-West Plains: Exhibited a deceleration in growth at -0.15%.\nOther Zones: The increasing trend showed acceleration, with rates of acceleration ranging between 0.80% and 0.32%.\nDistricts:\nSaharsa and Bhojpur: Showed deceleration in growth rates, at -0.54% and -1.64%, respectively.\nOther Districts: The growth rates were accelerating, ranging between 0.12% and 1.65%.\nIV.6.9 Area Under Rapeseed/Mustard\nTrend: The area under rapeseed/mustard remained stagnant until 1988-89 but began increasing thereafter. From 84.7 thousand ha. in 1970-71, it grew to 105.20 thousand ha. by 1992-93.\nGrowth Rates:\nOverall: Increased annually by 0.42% from 1971-93.\nFirst Sub-Period: The area expanded at 0.14% annually.\nSecond Sub-Period: The growth rate accelerated to 2.25% annually.\nInter-State Comparison: Bihar ranked ninth in area under rapeseed/mustard, with 109.10 thousand ha. in 1990-93, lagging behind Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Growth rates during 1983-93 were lower in Bihar (2.50%) compared to states like Gujarat (10.04%), Haryana (9.61%), Rajasthan (15.38%), and West Bengal (10.23%).\nIV.6.11 Regional Pattern\nMajor Zones:\nNorth-West and East Plains: Accounted for nearly four-fifths of the area under rapeseed/mustard.\nSouth-West and Plateau Districts: Had lesser coverage, with respective shares of 18.31% and 15.17%.\nHigh Area Districts:\nEast Plains: Begusarai (11.06%), Purnea (16.35%), Saharsa (6.44%), Katihar (4.86%).\nPlateau Zone: Santhal Parganas (6.10%), Palamu (5.24%).\nSouth-West Plains: Rohtas (4.76%), Bhojpur (4.75%).\nNorth-West Plains: Samastipur (6.16%), Siwan (5.15%), West Champaran (5.00%).\nIV.6.12 Trend Growth Rates in Area\nFirst Sub-Period: All zones,
