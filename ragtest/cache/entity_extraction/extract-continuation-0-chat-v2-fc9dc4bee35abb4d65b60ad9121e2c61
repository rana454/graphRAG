Arjun Singh\nAge: 38 Yrs\nVenture: Vegetable Farming\nVillage: Masona\nPanchayat: Amethi\nBlock: Sanjouli\nDistrict: Rohtas\nEducational Qualification: Intermediate (Arts)\nInstitution Facilitating Venture: Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), Rohtas\nOrganizational Capability of Grower Makes Vegetable Farming Lucrative\nArjun Singh’s ability to view problems from a broader perspective enabled him to increase his income from vegetable farming and assist other horticulturists in his area.\nBackground\nSingh began farming on his one-acre land in 2006 after completing intermediate education. Due to limited resources, he had to discontinue his studies and pursue farming. Despite initial resource constraints, Singh aimed to excel in agriculture.\nInitial Challenges and Innovations\nFacing low income from vegetable farming, Singh identified dependence on middlemen as a major issue. He decided to organize farmers to sell produce directly to bulk buyers. With support from KVK, Singh formed a farmer’s group called “Krisak Het Samuh, Masona” in 2009.\nAchievements\nThe group explored direct market linkages and successfully established contact with bulk purchasers in Delhi, Meerut, and Kanpur. This led to a significant increase in income, with the group registering Rs 1.2 crore in 2019 through tomato sales. Singh's net income from tomatoes rose to Rs 3.00 lakh to Rs 3.5 lakh per season.\nCurrent Status\nTomato farming has expanded in Masona, with over 200 acres dedicated to it. Singh also formed another group, “Pragatesheel Kissan Club,” increasing the membership and overall vegetable production in the area. The area is now known as a tomato hub in Bihar.\n\n2.

He returned home in 2011 to take charge of his family’s farm following his father’s death.\nInitial Ventures and Challenges\nInitially growing wheat and maize, Jha found limited returns. He sought advice from Bihar Agricultural University and KVK, leading him to explore farming of aromatic and medicinal plants.\nAchievements\nJha started cultivating Shatavari (Asparagus) and Kalmegh but faced setbacks. He returned to farming after Madhepura district was included in the Aroma Mission programme. With KVK’s support, he expanded to aromatic plants like mentha, khas, chamomile, and geraniums, and started organic vegetable farming.\nCurrent Status\nJha’s net annual income increased from Rs 1-1.5 lakh in 2012 to around Rs 3.5 lakh. He established a Farmer Producer Organization (FPO) and is also involved in a farm implement bank, assisting local farmers with modern equipment.\n\n3.

He worked as a salesman in Chhattisgarh before returning to his village in 2003 to help with farming.\nInitial Ventures and Challenges\nKumar started poultry farming with 200 broilers in 2005-06 but struggled with income. He realized the need for formal training to improve his poultry management techniques.\nAchievements\nIn 2017, Kumar received training from KVK, learning scientific poultry management techniques. He increased his poultry from 800 to over 2400 birds, improving his monthly income from Rs 8000-10000 to Rs 45000-50000.
