The east alluvial plains experienced a relatively high rate of increase at 4.91%. However, the north-west and plateau zones experienced declining trends in gram production at (-1.53%) and (-2.72%), respectively. Among districts, high growth rates in gram production were observed in less dominant gram growing districts such as:\nNalanda (23.94%)\nPatna (8.21%)\nMunger (6.76%)\nBhagalpur (5.48%)\nIV.5.4 Conclusions\nBased on the above discussion, the following conclusions can be drawn:\nThe production of gram showed a declining trend over the years in Bihar, with a sharp decline observed in the first sub-period. The declining trend continued in the second sub-period but at a reduced rate.\nThe yield of gram was relatively high in the south-west and east alluvial plains as compared to the north-west and plateau zones.\nMajor gram growing districts included Patna, Bhojpur, and Rohtas, contributing a significant share of the state's gram production.\nThe declining trend in gram production was more pronounced in states like Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan, whereas it showed an increasing trend in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh.\nDespite the decreasing trend, gram remains an important crop in Bihar, with substantial production concentrated in specific districts.\nTable IV.5.1\nArea, Production, and Yield as also Trend Growth Rates of Gram in Bihar during 1971-93\nTable IV.5.2\nCompound Annual Rate of Growth\nFigures in parentheses indicate the level of significance.\n\nIV.5 Gram\nIV.5.1 Production\nThe production of gram has been consistently declining in the state over the years. It was as high as 174.20 thousand tonnes in 1970-71, which declined to 123.90 thousand tonnes in 1981-82. It, however, recorded an upward movement in subsequent years but never reached the base level of 1970-71. During the eighties, the annual production of gram hovered around 140 to 160 thousand tonnes. The index number came down to its lowest at 56 in 1992-93. The trend rate of growth for the period 1971-93 showed a declining trend at (-0.25%). It showed a declining trend in both sub-periods. It was more sharp at (-2.09%) per annum during the first sub-period. The declining trend narrowed in the second sub-period at (-1.05%) per annum, due to wider application of HYV seeds/pesticides technology in particular. Bihar occupied sixth position in its production (135.7 thousand tonnes in 1990-93) with states such as Madhya Pradesh (1778.13 thousand tonnes), Uttar Pradesh (994.77 thousand tonnes), and Rajasthan (827.90 thousand tonnes) way ahead of Bihar. Declining trends in the production of gram were the general pattern across major gram growing states, except Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh. In these states, it showed an increasing trend ranging between 6.18% and 1.18% during 1983-93. Among the major gram growing states, the rate of decline was relatively high in Haryana (-1.28%), Uttar Pradesh (-2.24%), and Rajasthan (-3.17%) during the same period.\nIV.5.2 Regional Pattern\nAcross different zones, the south-west plains alone produced three-fifths (61.09%) of gram in the State. The share of other zones was much less at 18.76% for the east plains, 11.07% for the plateau districts, and 9.08% for the north-west plains. Among the districts, Patna (14.77%), Bhojpur (14.21%), and Rohtas (13.37%) were the major gram growing centers in the State, producing two-fifths of the State gram production. Other districts with relatively high shares of gram production included:\nPlateau: Palamu (5.02%)\nSouth-West Plains: Nalanda (6.28%) and Gaya (6.03%)\nEast: Munger (9.59%) and Bhagalpur (5.37%)\nNorth-West Plains: Darbhanga (2.27%) and Siwan (1.70%)\nIV.5.3 Trend Growth Rates\nAnalysis of trend growth rates in the production of gram for the period 1977-91 revealed that the south-west alluvial plains had an increasing trend in gram production (2.03%) during 1977-91. In other zones, viz. north-west alluvial plains, east alluvial plains, and plateau regions, it showed a declining trend at (-2.26%), (-1.08%), and (-0.90%), respectively. The declining trend became sharp in respect of the north-west alluvial plains from (-0.10%) in the first sub-period to (-4.21%) in the second sub-period. Declining trend continued to be sharp at (-2.96%) during the second sub-period as against (-2.82%) during the first\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
