In terms of growth as well, it showed an encouraging picture for Bihar. It grew annually at 2.22% in Bihar, 1.57% in Madhya Pradesh, and 0.59% in Uttar Pradesh during 1983-93. In Rajasthan, it showed a declining trend at (-1.36%). However, Maharashtra and Haryana showed better performance with yield levels growing annually at around 3.30% during the same period.\nIV.5.12 Yield by Zone and District\nAcross different zones, the south-west plains with high production of gram also showed a high yield level of gram at 0.98 t/ha. The zone of plateau districts had the least yield at 0.83 t/ha. Further, districts showing high levels of gram production also showed high levels of yield of gram. They included:\nSouth-West: Patna (1.25 t/ha) and Bhojpur (1.04 t/ha)\nNorth-West: Siwan (1.02 t/ha)\nEast: Begusarai (0.95 t/ha)\nPlateau: Santhal Parganas (0.77 t/ha) and Palamu (0.74 t/ha)\nIV.6 Rapeseed/Mustard\nIV.6.1 Production\nRapeseed/mustard are the most important crops among oilseeds in terms of both area (105.43 thousand ha) and production (88.77 thousand tonnes) in Bihar. It formed 51.5% of the oilseeds area and 65.3% of oilseeds production in 1990-93 in the state. The analysis of the growth pattern in area, production, and yield of rapeseed/mustard crops during 1971-93 at State level and 1977-91 at zone/district level is presented below.\nIV.6.2 Production of Rapeseed/Mustard\nProduction of rapeseed/mustard increased significantly during 1971-93 in the State. It was 49.0 thousand tonnes in 1970-71, which increased to a maximum of 109.0 thousand tonnes with the index number touching 222 in 1991-92. However, there was wide year-to-year fluctuation with minimum and maximum production at 34.9 and 109.0 thousand tonnes, respectively. While the first sub-period experienced stagnation with production hovering around 40.0 to 50.0 thousand tonnes, the second sub-period witnessed phenomenal increase in output. The trend rate of growth was negative at (-0.76%) per annum for the first sub-period and positive at 5.26% per annum for the second sub-period.\nIV.6.3 Comparative Analysis\nBihar was not a major rapeseed/mustard growing state, ranking ninth among the states in its production. Rapeseed/mustard production was as high as 1924.93 thousand tonnes in Rajasthan, followed by 1034.77 thousand tonnes in Uttar Pradesh, whereas it was only 88.77 thousand tonnes in Bihar in 1990-93. Increase in rapeseed/mustard production in Bihar also does not compare well with the national average and other major states. For example, during 1983-93, while production of rapeseed/mustard grew annually at 7.34% in Bihar, it was 8.76% at the all-India level, 15.97% in Haryana, 14.44% in Gujarat, 12.97% in Madhya Pradesh, 17.50% in Rajasthan, and 13.43% in West Bengal.\nIV.6.4 Regional Pattern\nThe zone of east plains was the major producer of rapeseed/mustard, contributing 43.30% to the State production. It was no less in the case of the north-west plains, contributing 37.62% of the State production. The share of other zones was relatively much less at 18.02% for the south-west and 9.64% for the plateau districts. Among the districts, Begusarai (16.81%) and Purnea (14.00%) figured prominently in its production. Other districts with relatively high share in rapeseed/mustard production included Santhal Parganas (4.26%) and Palamu (3.14%) in the plateau; Bhojpur (3.50%), Patna (4.46%), and Rohtas (4.64%) in the south-west plains; Saharsa (5.99%) and Katihar (2.59%) in the east plains; and Samastipur (8.49%), Siwan (5.89%), and West Champaran (4.71%) in the north-west plains.\nIV.6.5 Trend Growth Rates\nAnalyzing the trend growth rates across different agro-climatic zones, it is observed that while in the first sub-period all agro-climatic zones as well as the State experienced a declining trend in production, the trend reversed in the second sub-period at the State level and for two major zones. The decline was as high as (-11.07%) in the plateau districts and as low as (-0.21%) in the south-west alluvial plains. The second sub-period brought a reversal in the positive direction in all zones, except the north-west alluvial plains which continued to experience a declining trend at an accelerated rate even during this period. The rate of decline in this zone was (-0.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
