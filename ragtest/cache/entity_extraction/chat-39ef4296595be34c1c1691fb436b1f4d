As per the Census 2011, about 70% of the workforce is engaged in agriculture either as a cultivator or agricultural laborers. The availability of fertile alluvial soil, adequate rainfall, and other favorable agro-climatic conditions provide a congenial environment for the cultivation of a variety of food grains, vegetables, fruits, spices, and other commercial crops.\nThe government of Bihar has taken various policy and institutional initiatives in the last 15 years under the three Agricultural Road Maps which have transformed the agricultural landscape of the state. The investments made by the state government in the areas of irrigation and rural infrastructure, as laid out in the Agriculture Road Maps, have boosted agricultural outputs, increased crop yields, and enhanced diversification. The production of cereals in the state has reached 181 Lakh MT in 2021-22 from 113.4 Lakh MT in 2007-08. Similarly, the production of fruits has increased to 49.77 Lakh MT from 32.52 Lakh MT, while that of vegetables has risen to 178.4 Lakh MT from 140.6 Lakh MT in 2007-08.\nBihar is self-sufficient in the production of food grains, and the focus has now shifted to the management of surplus to ensure that the gains in production and productivity are translating into higher prices. An efficient agricultural marketing ecosystem in the state will ensure that farmers are getting the optimal price for agricultural produce. The state government has established the Bihar Agricultural Produce Value Addition System (BAVAS) in the Department of Agriculture for the development of the agricultural marketing ecosystem in the state. The division is making concerted efforts to improve farmers' access to markets by working in the areas of infrastructure development for domestic and international trade, bridging information gaps, adopting digital technologies, and providing support to farmers’ collectives.\nProgress So Far\nThe state government has accorded top priority to the development of agriculture and allied sectors with the roadmap-based strategy. Agriculture Roadmap-based strategies helped the state achieve a very high level of production and productivity of food grains. The second roadmap helped farmers improve their market access through improved rural connectivity and enhanced storage capacity in the state through the construction of new godowns. The storage capacity in the state increased by more than three times by the end of the second roadmap.\nProvisions of previous roadmaps have also boosted the growth of the food processing industry in the state, which has contributed to a higher amount of value addition activities. More than 300 food processing units were started in the state during the second agriculture roadmap.\nThe third agriculture roadmap paved the way for the renovation and development of government agricultural market yards, with work on renovation started in 22 agricultural produce market yards. Basic infrastructure such as internal roads, drainage systems, toilet blocks, high mast lights, etc., were developed in these market yards. To bridge the information gap between farmers and markets, the department also started the collection and dissemination of price and\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
