The pace of increase in yield level also lagged behind in Bihar, with a growth rate of 2.80% per annum during 1983-93 compared to the national average of 3.14%. Haryana showed a faster pace of increase at 4.0% per annum during the same period.\nIV.3.11 Trend in Yield of Wheat\nAcross different zones, the average yield of wheat was similar in the north-west and south-west plains at 1.79 t/ha and 1.78 t/ha, respectively. Districts such as Patna (2.22 t/ha) and Nalanda (2.14 t/ha) in the south-west; Samastipur (2.10 t/ha) and Gopalganj (2.02 t/ha) in the north-west; and Begusarai (2.02 t/ha) in the east plains showed relatively high yield levels of wheat. Districts with yields higher than the state average (1.71 t/ha) included East Champaran (1.92 t/ha), Saran (1.98 t/ha), and Siwan (1.92 t/ha) in the north-west; and Bhojpur (1.79 t/ha) and Nawadah (1.76 t/ha) in the south-west plains.\nIV.3.12 Rate of Growth in Yield\nThe increase in yield of wheat was experienced across all agro-climatic zones, albeit at varying rates. The highest growth rate was 2.73% per annum in the north-west alluvial plains, followed by 2.51% in the south-west alluvial plains during 1977-91. The east alluvial plains had a growth rate of 1.33%, and the plateau region showed a low trend growth rate of 0.13%. From the mid-eighties, even the plateau districts experienced impressive increases in yield levels. The plateau region reversed from a declining trend rate of -3.90% in the first sub-period to an increasing trend of 2.60% per annum during the second sub-period. The rate of increase in yield was more impressive in other agro-climatic zones, particularly in the south-west alluvial plains (4.15%) and the north-west alluvial plains (3.62%) during the second sub-period. The east alluvial plains lagged behind with a growth rate of 0.92%. In various districts, the rate of growth in yield of wheat was relatively high in less dominant wheat-growing districts such as Munger (4.72%), Nawadah (6.51%), Patna (5.27%), and Hazaribagh (6.46%).\nIV.3.13 Conclusions\nThe following broad conclusions are thus arrived at:\nProduction: Wheat production in the state showed impressive acceleration, particularly during the second sub-period. Much of the increase in production was due to yield improvement, although area expansion also contributed significantly.\nRegional Distribution: The north-west (40.93%) and south-west (35.41%) zones had a large share in wheat production. Prominent districts in wheat production included Rohtas (9.92%), Bhojpur (7.43%), Begusarai (5.95%), East Champaran (5.65%), Gopalganj (5.65%), Saran (5.44%), and Siwan (5.27%).\nGrowth Rates: The growth rates in wheat production were impressive in both the north-west and south-west plains. Districts such as West Champaran, Begusarai, and Nalanda showed growth rates comparable to the national average and other major wheat-growing states.\nHigh Growth Districts: During the second sub-period, districts such as East Champaran, Sitamarhi, Nalanda, Nawadah, Hazaribagh, and Palamu showed growth rates exceeding 8.0%.\nArea vs. Yield: In districts like Darbhanga, Sitamarhi, Begusarai, and Purnea, increases in wheat production were largely due to area expansion. Conversely, in districts such as East Champaran, Sitamarhi, Gaya, Nawadah, Patna, Hazaribagh, and Palamu, increases were mainly due to yield improvements.\nYield Levels: Several districts, including Gopalganj, Samastipur, Begusarai, Nalanda, and Patna, had average wheat yields close to the national average but still fell short compared to Haryana and Punjab.\n\nIV.3. Wheat\nArea, Production, and Yield Trends\nArea, Production, and Yield Data (1970-71 to 1992-93):\n\nCompound Annual Rate of Growth (CARG):\n\nKey Insights:\nOverall Growth: Significant increase in area and production of wheat with steady improvements in yield.\nFirst Sub-period (1970-71 to 1982-83): Higher growth rates in area (2.22%) and production (2.72%) but slower yield growth (0.46%).\nSecond Sub-period (1983-84 to 1992-93): Moderate area growth (1.34%) but higher production growth (3.50%) and improved yield growth (2.19%).\nRegional Patterns and Trends:\nArea and Production Distribution:\nThe north-west and south-west zones had the highest share in wheat production and area. Significant production was observed in districts such as Rohtas, Bhojpur, Gaya, Purnea, and Begusarai.\nYield Trends:\nYield increased significantly across all zones, with the plateau region showing a marked turnaround\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HARYANA<|>GEO<|>A state in India known for its high wheat yield levels, significantly higher than the national average)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUNJAB<|>GEO<|>A state in India with one of the highest wheat yield levels, surpassing many other regions in the country)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India where the pace of increase in wheat yield has lagged behind the national average)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PATNA<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar known for its relatively high wheat yield levels)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NALANDA<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with high wheat yield levels)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMASTIPUR<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar noted for its wheat production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOPALGANJ<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with notable wheat yield levels)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEGUSARAI<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar recognized for its wheat production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EAST CHAMPARAN<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with higher than state average wheat yields)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SARAN<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar known for its wheat yield levels)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIWAN<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with significant wheat production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BHOJPUR<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with notable wheat yields)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAWADAH<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar known for its impressive growth rate in wheat yield)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUNGER<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with a high growth rate in wheat yield)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAZARIBAGH<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with a significant growth rate in wheat yield)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PALAMU<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar noted for its growth rate in wheat production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROHTAS<|>GEO<|>Prominent district in Bihar for wheat production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SITAMARHI<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with growth rates in wheat production exceeding 8.0%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAYA<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar where increases in wheat production were mainly due to yield improvements)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DARBHANGA<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar where increases in wheat production were largely due to area expansion)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PURNIA<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with significant wheat production, largely due to area expansion)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PATNA<|>BIHAR<|>Patna is a district in Bihar known for its relatively high wheat yield levels<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NALANDA<|>BIHAR<|>Nalanda is a district in Bihar with high wheat yield levels<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARYANA<|>PUNJAB<|>Both Haryana and Punjab are states in India known for their high wheat yield levels, significantly higher than Bihar<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NAWADAH<|>BIHAR<|>Nawadah is a district in Bihar known for its impressive growth rate in wheat yield<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAZARIBAGH<|>BIHAR<|>Hazaribagh is a district in Bihar with a significant growth rate in wheat yield<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
