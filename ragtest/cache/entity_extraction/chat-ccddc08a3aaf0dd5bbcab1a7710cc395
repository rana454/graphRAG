This increase in seed consumption in the backdrop of their falling acreage is explained by an increase in seed replacement ratio and increasing use of HYVs for these crops. The acreage of paddy under HYVs has increased by almost 4 percent over the period 1999-2005, and that of wheat under HYVs has increased by around 2 percent over the same period (Table 2.16). Arrangements have been made to supply 48,000 quintals of maize seeds, 3,500 quintals of arhar, 1,400 quintals of urad, and 420 quintals of moong for kharif 2006. Seed requirement for rabi-2006 has been estimated at 300 thousand quintals. The estimate for maize seeds in rabi-2006 was 60 thousand quintals.\nFor several years, Bihar State Seed Corporation had become non-functional and agricultural farms of the State government were lying barren. In the current financial year, the State government has approved restarting seed production by Bihar State Seed Corporation for the next five years with an outlay of Rs. 27.12 crore. Seed production for paddy has started on 45 agricultural farms in the last kharif season, and 10,000 quintals of HYV paddy seeds have been produced. In the current rabi season, a program for the production of wheat seeds is being carried out. This would facilitate timely and economical availability of modern crop breeds to the farmers.\nFertilisers\nFertiliser consumption in the State has steadily increased over the years. The consumption of fertilizers has increased from 85 kgs/hectare to 110 kgs/hectare in 2005-06 (Table 2.18). The estimated consumption for 2006-07 is 125 kgs/hectare. For 2006, the State government has estimated the fertilizer consumption to be 9 lakh MT of urea, 3 lakh MT of DAP, 90,000 MT of MOP, 1.5 lakh MT of NPK, and 60,000 MT of SSP, 90 percent of which has been allocated by the Central government. Despite an increase over the years, fertilizer consumption per hectare in the State is lower than the national average. Besides the low level, an important problem is the distorted consumption pattern of fertilizers in the State. While the ideal ratio of NPK consumption should be 4:2:1, the consumption pattern in Bihar has become increasingly distorted over the years (Table 2.19). The NPK ratio has worsened from around 12:3:1 in 2000-01 to 24:2:1 in 2003-04, but fortunately improved to 7:1:1 in 2005-06. This problem, along with others, is being addressed by the extension initiatives of the State government, such as the establishment of soil testing laboratories and Krishi Vikas Kendras (KVK) in each block.\nCredit\nFrom an already low level, agriculture’s share in total bank credit has fallen over the last 5 years. While its share was at 24 percent in 2000-01, it fell to 20 percent in 2003-04. Though it has registered an increase to 23 percent in 2004-05, it is still lower than the share in 2000-01. The entire rural credit delivery system is not in good shape in Bihar. In terms of access of cultivators to the banking institutions, the average population per bank branch in Bihar, as of the end of June 2006, was 25,000, as against the national average of 16,000 (RBI 2006). While the number of commercial bank branches in the State is 2,082, only 60.37 percent of these branches operate in rural areas. There are 5 Regional Rural Banks in the State, with 1,486 branches, of which around 86 percent are located in rural areas. The credit-deposit ratio (CDR) of RRBs at 44.77 percent is much higher than those of commercial banks.\nTaking the entire banking sector, a total of 4,015 branches of 72 banks cater to the 82.9 million strong population of the State (Table 2.20). Even this sparse banking infrastructure is disproportionately oriented towards the urban economy of the State, with only 72 percent of total branches catering to the rural areas which are home to nearly 90 percent of the population. Total allocation of credit to agriculture in Bihar has been increasing over the last few years, but has remained way behind the target credit mark.\nCommercial banks account for the largest share of the total credit disbursed to agriculture in the State, though this share has fallen moderately in recent years, from 70.30 percent in 2002-03 to 68.51 percent in 2005-06 (Table 2.21). Total outstanding credit as of March 2005 of all scheduled commercial banks to agriculture stood at Rs. 2,973.52 crore, out of which direct credit was Rs. 2,634.49 crore and indirect credit was Rs. 339.03 crore. The share of regional rural banks in total agricultural credit has fluctuated around 20 percent, although it registered a sharp fall in 2003-04 to 13 percent. Similarly, the share of cooperative banks in total agricultural credit is found to be about 12 percent, although it was suddenly high at 36 percent in 2003-04.\nThe agricultural credit need was estimated to be Rs. 11,341.22 crore for Bihar in 2006\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
