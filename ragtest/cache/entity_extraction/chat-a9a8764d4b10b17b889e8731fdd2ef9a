In the current year, Bihar State Seed Corporation has been revived and production of seeds is being undertaken by it on 45 state-managed farms which remained inoperative for some years. More than 1100 agriculture graduates have been trained as agriclinics in the State. The utilization of technical expertise of these trained youths is necessary for agricultural development. A decision was taken in the current year to use the seeds produced by agriclinics for public sector programmes. In the current year, the Kisan Samman Yojna was also launched to identify and acknowledge enterprising farmers in the State and using them as extension agents. This plan is a unique and innovative programme of extension reforms.\n2.7 Horticulture\nBihar is one of the major producers of vegetables and fruits in India with 9.8 and 6.7 percent of national production respectively. It ranks third and sixth among other States in the production of vegetables and fruits respectively. Fruit area in the State is 2.91 lakh hectares which is around 7.8 percent of the total fruit area in the country (Table 2.23). In general, yield rates of fruits and vegetables are lower in Bihar than those of other States. However, they are among the highest for okra and litchis. The annual production of fresh fruits in Bihar is about 29.20 lakh MT. In addition, vegetables are grown in an area of 4.87 lakh hectares from which around 72.58 lakh MT of vegetables is produced (Table 2.24). Besides this, potato cultivation takes place in an area of 3.05 lakh hectares from which 53.07 lakh MT of potato are produced.\nMakhana cultivation is done in about 5000 hectares in the entire country, 90 percent of which falls in Bihar. Projects for production of makhana, litchis, and mangoes are currently being promoted by NABARD under RSVY in the districts of Muzaffarpur, Darbhanga, Samastipur, and Madhubani. About 30 percent of the total area in the State is planned to be diverted from other crops towards horticulture. During the last two years, 2005-06 and 2006-07, plans for horticulture development are being run in the State with 100 percent grant from the Central government under the National Horticulture Mission (NHM). The districts left out by the NHM are being covered under the Chief Minister’s Horticulture Mission. This plan consists of expansion of area under fruit orchards, commercial flower cultivation, cultivation of medicinal plants, bee-keeping, integrated pest management, training of cultivators and officers, post-harvest management, etc. This plan is to be implemented in the public as well as private areas.\nApproximately 25-40 percent of the vegetables and fruits are lost due to lack of proper transport and storage facilities. Because of these handicaps, fruits and vegetables produced in the State are mainly sold fresh in the market, often implying distress sale by the farmers. While mandi markets are the mandated sales outlet for fruits and vegetable products, yet just 6 percent of vegetable production and 4.2 percent of fruit production get shelf space in APMCs.\nThe State has been plagued by substantive losses of fruit and vegetable output affected by lack of adequate cold storage and godown capacity. Bihar has only 160 rural godowns (0.12 percent of the country’s godowns) with an approximate capacity of 17,000 tons, which compares very poorly with the figure of 3,015 rural godowns for Punjab, which is around 24 percent of the country’s capacity. Similarly, although Bihar produces about 10 percent of all vegetables and nearly 7 percent of all fruits, it has only 5 percent of the total storage capacity in India. Of the 238 cold storage units available, 187 are used for potatoes. Thus 77 percent of the capacity of these cold storage units are used to store potatoes alone, leaving only 23 percent for other purposes. The majority (92 percent) of the State’s cold storage facilities is owned by the private sector and the rest by the cooperatives (8 percent). The State has been adding to its storage and preservation capacities over the last few years. Under the Plan of cold storage construction, capacity expansion, and modernization in the State (with financial assistance from Central government), permission has been given for construction of 42 new cold storages since 2000, out of which 22 cold storages have started functioning and the remaining ones are under construction.\n2.8 Forestry\nOut of the total geographical area of 94,163 sq. kms. of the State, only 6473 sq. kms is under natural forests, which comprises only 6.87 percent of the total geographical area. Out of 38 districts, these forests are located in only 10 districts. According to the Forest Survey Institute, Dehradun, there are only 13.6 trees/hectare in the areas outside the forest regions of the State.\nAccording to the Indian Forest Policy 1988, 33 percent of the geographical area should be under forests for environmental balance. In a densely populated region like Bihar, it is difficult to increase the area under forests. But it can be compensated by making alternative arrangements and using all the empty lands of the State. Under the already launched Kishore Chetna Vriksh Yojna, awareness about the environment, especially about trees, is sought to be created among the school students and their participation is being ensured in the afforestation programmes.\n2\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
