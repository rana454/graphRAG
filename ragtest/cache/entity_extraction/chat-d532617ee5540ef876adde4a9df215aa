The zones of:\nSouth-West (16.43%)\nEast Alluvial Plains (11.98%)\nwere relatively more dominant in pulse cultivation. Districts that figured prominently in pulse area included:\nDarbhanga (12.60%)\nMuzaffarpur (13.67%)\nVaishali (12.29%) in the north-west\nBhagalpur (13.94%)\nMunger (16.12%)\nSaharsa (18.23%) in the east plains\nAurangabad (18.12%)\nNalanda (17.51%)\nPatna (29.66%) in the south-west plains\nPalamu (20.33%) in the plateau zone\nV.5 Major Non-Food Crops\nAmong the non-food crops, the major ones were:\nRapeseed/Mustard\nSugarcane\nPotato\nTobacco\nChilli\nJute\nAnalysis suggests that the cultivation of these crops was area/region specific:\nRapeseed/Mustard was more prominent in the East Plains (1.48%) and the North-West Plains (0.97%).\nSugarcane was dominated by the North-West (3.51%).\nPotato was almost uniformly spread across different zones.\nTobacco was restricted to the North-West Plains.\nJute was the specialty of the East Plains.\nV.6 Area Shifts Across Different Crops\nIt is significant to observe that there was a shift of area in favor of:\nCereal Crops\nFruits and Vegetables\nFibre Crops\nwith trend rates of growth per annum in the percentage area of these crops positive at:\n0.22% for cereals\n1.65% for fruits and vegetables\n0.37% for fibre crops\nOn the other hand, crop groups such as:\nPulses\nOilseeds\nSpices\nMiscellaneous Crops\nwere losing area to other crops, with trend rates of growth declining annually at:\n(-1.35%) for pulses\n(-0.27%) for oilseeds\n(-4.80%) for spices\n(-0.26%) for miscellaneous crops during the same period.\n(i) Cereals\nV.7 Between the two sub-periods, area expansion was higher in the second sub-period compared to the first. Analysis of trend rates of growth separately for superior and coarse cereals suggests that:\nSuperior Cereals gained in area with a trend rate of growth at 0.63%.\nCoarse Cereals showed shrinkage in area with a trend rate of growth at (-2.13%) during this period.\nV.8 Area expansion of superior cereals slackened in the second sub-period with a trend rate of growth at 0.23% per annum, whereas it was 0.43% per annum in the first sub-period. Coarse cereals showed an opposite trend, with the second sub-period recovering in the declining trend. While it declined annually at (-1.22%) in the first sub-period, the declining trend slackened to (-0.08%) in the second sub-period.\n(ii) Fruits and Vegetables\nV.9 Fruits and vegetables showed a high rate of area expansion at 11.15% per annum during the first sub-period. The second sub-period showed a reversal to a declining trend, albeit marginally at (-1.0%) per annum. Production of fruits (mainly banana) and vegetables (mainly potato and onion) picked up fast in Bihar during the late seventies and continued up to the mid-eighties.\n(iii) Pulses\nV.10 Area under pulses showed shrinkage consistently since 1970-71. However, the rate of decline was higher at (-2.02%) per annum in the first sub-period and lower at (-1.20%) per annum in the second sub-period. The deceleration in the declining trend rate of growth in the second sub-period could largely be due to the fact that it reached a minimum level below which further decline could not be possible to ensure a minimum supply of pulses at the farm level.\n(iv) Oilseeds\nV.11 In the case of oilseed crops, the first sub-period witnessed significant area expansion growing annually at 3.16%. The second sub-period, however, experienced a stagnant situation with a trend rate of growth, although declining but low at (-0.10%).\n(v) Spices\nV.12 Spices also showed a declining trend in area. It had a share of 0.27% in the gross cropped area in 1970-71, which continued to decline, reaching the lowest level of 0.08% in 1990-91. The rate of decline in the percentage share has been steep in both sub-periods, (-6.35%) in the first sub-period and (-6.00%) in the second sub-period. Prominent spice crops produced in Bihar include chili, turmeric, coriander, and garlic. They are mostly cultivated for the market. Prices of spices have been increasing in recent years, making the shrinkage in area under spices a puzzle that needs further investigation.\nArea Shifts of Individual Cereal Crops\nV.13 Both superior cereals, such as paddy and wheat, showed area expansion during 1971-93. However, gains in area expansion for wheat (1.50% per annum) were much higher compared to paddy (0.10% per annum). Further:\nWheat showed area expansion almost uniformly\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
