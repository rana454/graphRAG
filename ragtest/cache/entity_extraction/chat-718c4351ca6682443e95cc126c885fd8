All these crops showed an increasing trend in output.\nThe rate of growth was relatively more for wheat (3.50%) and maize (3.80%) during the second sub-period. For paddy, the growth rate was 2.59% per annum.\nIncrease in paddy and maize output was largely due to yield increase, as the area showed stagnant behavior. Maize showed significant area shrinkage. In the case of wheat, both area and yield contributed to the growth in output.\nComparative Growth:\nGrowth in wheat output during the second sub-period in Bihar was comparable to that in agriculturally developed states like Punjab and Haryana.\nHowever, in the case of paddy and maize, Bihar lagged far behind other major states.\nYield Comparison:\nThe State lagged behind in terms of yield of these crops as well. While the yield for wheat in Bihar was 1790 kg/ha, it was 3760 kg/ha in Punjab and 3570 kg/ha in Haryana in 1990-93.\nFor paddy, it was 1001 kg/ha in Bihar as against 3293 kg/ha in Punjab, 3117 kg/ha in Tamil Nadu, and 1743 kg/ha at the all-India level.\nPaddy Production:\nGrowth in paddy output was region-specific with districts of the south-west plains leading over other zones.\nDistricts with relatively high growth rate in paddy output included Nalanda, Nawadah, Saran, Munger, and Palamu.\nAlthough winter paddy was dominant in terms of production, the rate of growth in production was higher for autumn and summer paddy. Yield levels were relatively higher for summer paddy.\nWhile winter paddy was cultivated widely across different agro-climatic zones, cultivation of summer and autumn paddy was region-specific. For autumn paddy, the districts of the north-west plains dominated, whereas for summer paddy, the districts of the east plains dominated.\nWheat Production:\nProduction of wheat was district-specific, largely in the north-west and south-west plains.\nDistricts with high shares in State wheat production included Rohtas (9.92%), Bhojpur (7.43%), Begusarai (5.95%), East Champaran (5.65%), Gopalganj (5.65%), Saran (5.44%), and Siwan (5.27%).\nThe rate of growth was relatively high in less predominant districts such as Sitamarhi (10.39%), Nalanda (9.51%), Nawadah (8.75%), and Hazaribagh (12.02%). Both yield and area increase contributed to growth in wheat output. The rate of growth in wheat production in all such districts was comparable to that in agriculturally developed states.\nArhar Production:\nProduction of arhar experienced a reversal in Bihar, although at a slackened rate in the second sub-period.\nThe decline in arhar production was due to area shrinkage, as yield was found to be increasing.\nProduction of arhar was region-specific with districts of the north-west plains leading, although these districts also showed a declining trend in arhar production. Compared to other states growing arhar, while Bihar was ahead in terms of yield level, it lagged far behind in production due to a much smaller area under the crop.\nGram Cultivation:\nLike arhar, the cultivation of gram was region-specific, with the south-west plains alone producing two-thirds of the State's production.\nWhile the State lagged in terms of area under gram, it was well ahead of other states in terms of yield. A reversal in gram production was observed in zones/districts with low area under gram. The zones/districts with a dominant share in gram production showed an increasing trend in both area and yield.\nRapeseed/Mustard Production:\nBihar, ranking ninth among the states, was emerging fast in rapeseed/mustard production, growing annually at 7.34% during the eighties.\nThe yield level in the State compared well with other major states. Both area expansion and yield increase contributed to the growth.\nProduction of rapeseed/mustard was region-specific with districts of the north-west and east plains having a dominant share. The rate of growth in these districts compared well with major states.\nSugarcane Production:\nIn terms of area, yield, and production of sugarcane, Bihar was next to Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu.\nMoreover, production of sugarcane in the State showed a declining trend up to 1986-87 with wide year-to-year fluctuation. From 1987-88 onwards, however, it took an upswing with production reaching the level of 6031.8 thousand tonnes in 1992-93.\nThe upswing in sugarcane production during the second sub-period was attributable to both area expansion and yield increase. Production of sugarcane was region-specific with adjacent districts, namely East Champaran, West Champaran, and Gopalganj in the north-west plains, having a dominant share. Growth of sugarcane production in the state during the eighties was comparable to that in major sugarcane-growing states.\nJute Production:\nBihar has been traditionally growing jute. Jute production showed an increasing trend, although at a slackened rate during the second sub-period.\nThe increase in jute production was more due to yield increase, as area remained more or less stagnant. Production of jute was region-specific with the east plains having a dominant share. Districts such as Purnea, Katihar\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
