The increasing menace of soil erosion is the root cause of land turning barren in the plateau, caused largely by deforestation as well as abandonment of mines. The scale of investment required for treating abandoned mines or for afforestation programs may warrant the involvement of the corporate sector. This needs to be examined separately.\n42. The study clearly revealed that while paddy, maize, small millets, other coarse cereals, arhar, gram, linseed, chillies, etc. showed shrinkage in area, crops such as wheat, rapeseed/mustard, jute, and turmeric showed expansion in area. To check the decline in the area of these crops and to provide the necessary impetus to sustain accelerated growth in some of these crops, there is a need to further enlarge crop-specific and area-specific development programs after identifying constraints to the growth of these crops.\nii) Strengthening Flow of Inputs\n43. Although crop yield has of late been increasing in the state, it is yet to reach the level of agriculturally developed states. The relatively low crop yield in the state is clearly attributable to low use of modern inputs. The following action points are suggested separately for specific inputs:\n44. Fertilizer is a major component of the modern yield-augmenting package. However, its use is observed to be not only low but also unbalanced in the state. The unbalanced use of fertilizer is more in favor of nitrogen and deficient in potash and phosphorous, particularly in intensively cultivated regions. Application of manure and compost is absent. Quality of fertilizer and timeliness of its supply is necessary to enhance the use of fertilizer in a more balanced manner. The following steps would be desirable for enhanced and balanced use of fertilizer in the state:\nTenant cultivators as well may be brought under the gamut of production credit by relaxing norms.\nSupply arrangements for fertilizer also need radical changes to ensure quality as well as timeliness.\nSimultaneous use of compost and manure may be popularized, making them components of crop loans.\n45. Irrigation is basic to the yield-augmenting modern package. It was, however, not only low but also inefficient and costly in the state. The following package of programs would be essential to step up irrigation in the state:\nCreating new irrigation potential needs to be stepped up, involving more private investment with adequate and timely credit support.\nCredit support for investment in irrigation may be extended to include tenant cultivators as well.\nSeparate schemes for infructuous investments may be implemented to facilitate their utilization.\nAs a measure to reduce the cost of irrigation, a program of large-scale farm electrification may be emphasized.\nLow-cost treadle pumps, appropriate for fragmented small holdings, may be encouraged under plan efforts.\n46. Use of HYV seeds was low in the state. Moreover, it was restricted to a few crops, that too under irrigated conditions. Paddy, despite being the dominant crop, received neglect in the dissemination of HYVs, particularly the winter variety. Multiplication and replacement rates of HYV seeds were also low. The quality of the HYVs has also been questioned. The following points of action could be important in the dissemination of HYV seed technology in the state:\nThe R&D effort to evolve drought-resistant HYV seeds for a variety of crops, mainly paddy, is of paramount importance.\nSeed multiplication programs, including those in the private sector, may be tagged with bank schemes for necessary financial support.\nSeed certification may be made stringent and scientific.\nInfrastructure for storage of seeds at district/taluk level must be created, involving bank support to protect the seeds from spoilage.\n\nCHAPTER I\nINTRODUCTION\n1.1 The growth rate in Net State Domestic Product (NSDP) at factor cost (at 1980-81 prices) in Bihar was 3.12% per annum during 1971-81. It increased to 4.21% during the subsequent period, i.e., 1981-91. The per capita income at constant prices (1980-81) increased from Rs. 919 in 1980-81 to Rs. 1142 in 1991-92, recording an annual growth rate of about 2.0%, compared to just 0.93% per annum during 1971-81. The growth rate in NSDP of the State was, however, not encouraging when compared with the all-India average (4.42%) and those in more developed states like Maharashtra (5.10%) and Punjab (5.31%).\n1.2 The sectoral analysis of the NSDP suggests that much of the growth in Bihar emanated from the industrial and service sectors, which grew annually at 7.9% and 5.5% respectively during 1981-90. The NSDP from agriculture grew marginally at 0.16% during the same period. On the other hand, while the industrial sector contributed 17.38% and the service sector 28.48% to the NSDP, the share of the agriculture sector was high at 51.14% in 1980-81. The relative share of the industrial sector in NSDP increased to 25.46% and that of the service sector to 34.01% in 1989-90. Consequently, the agriculture sector's share declined to 40.53% in 1989-90.\n1.3 Of the total population of 864 lakhs in 1991, around 278 lakhs (32.3%) were main workers in the state, of which 81.1% were engaged in agriculture either as cultivators or as agricultural laborers. With such an overwhelming size of workforce depending on agriculture and other sectors\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
