However, gains in area expansion for wheat (1.50% per annum) were much higher compared to paddy (0.10% per annum). Further:\nWheat showed area expansion almost uniformly in both sub-periods at 1.52% and 1.26%, respectively.\nPaddy showed shrinkage in area at (-0.48%) per annum in the second sub-period.\nThus, while paddy formed 63.83% of the total cereals area in 1970-71, it reduced to 57.64% in 1992-93. In the case of wheat, while it formed 15.92% in 1970-71, it increased to 26.25% in 1992-93. For jowar and bajra, the shrinkage in area became more prominent and sharp at (-4.19%) and (-4.39%) per annum, respectively, in the second sub-period. The percentage share of these crops in total cereals area reduced to 0.05% and 0.10%, respectively, in 1992-93.\nV.14 Maize was once a prominent coarse cereal in Bihar, occupying around 12.0% of the total cereals area in 1970-71. Area under maize remained stagnant, hovering around 10.0% up to 1981-82, and declined thereafter, forming around 8.0% to 9.0% of the total cereals area. While the first sub-period witnessed a decline at (-0.54%) per annum, it showed marginal improvement in the second sub-period with a rate of growth reversing to an increasing trend at 0.07% per annum. Loss of area under coarse cereals, particularly maize, occurred largely in favor of superior cereals, mainly wheat. Maize is sown in both Kharif and Rabi seasons. With the relative economics of wheat being more favorable due to high relative prices, farmers seemed to substitute wheat for maize. Moreover, it was also a substitution of coarse cereals for superior cereals. Ragi was another important coarse cereal to lose its area significantly to superior cereals in the second sub-period with a trend rate of growth at (-5.01%) per annum.\nV.15 Analysis of area shifts among pulses was more revealing. Pulse's shares in the gross cropped area showed a significant decline, suggesting loss of pulse area to other crops, mainly superior cereals. It formed 14.90% of the gross cropped area in 1970-71, which reduced to 10.23% in 1992-93. Among pulses:\nArhar and gram continued to show a declining trend at (-1.14%) and (-0.80%), respectively.\nOther pulses showed an increasing trend at 0.26% during 1971-93.\nAnalyzing the trend of area shifts across two sub-periods:\nArhar and gram experienced area shifts in both sub-periods.\nOther pulses gained area in both sub-periods.\nOther pulse crops include mainly masoor, urad, and khesari. With an increase in irrigation and other crops having less favorable economics of cultivation, the context of spurt in arhar prices makes the significant shrinkage of arhar area puzzling and needs further examination. Loss of gram area could largely be attributed to vagaries of nature, as it is cultivated under rainfed conditions. Pulses like masoor and urad are also cultivated under rainfed conditions but have greater resistance to withstand dry spells. Farmers cultivate more of other pulses, substituting gram or arhar largely to ensure minimum pulse production for self-consumption.\nV.16 Oilseeds showed shrinkage in area in both sub-periods, with almost equal intensity, losing to other crops, mainly cereals. However, when examining the trend and pattern of area shifts across oilseed crops themselves, it is significant to observe that while rapeseed/mustard showed encouraging gains in area, linseed and nigerseed showed a loss of area. Increasing area under rapeseed/mustard began in the early eighties, showing expansion from 1981-82 with a share at 35.57% in total oilseeds area to as high as 55.57% in 1992-93. Shifts in area in its favor were observed at 3.22% per annum during the second sub-period as against the declining trend at (-0.16%) during the first sub-period. In the case of linseed, the reversal in area started in the second sub-period with a trend rate of growth at (-2.98%) as against the increasing trend rate of growth at 1.73% in the first sub-period. Nigerseed was the worst loser with its share at 25.0% in 1970-71, but reducing to 13.68% in 1992-93. The rate of decline was equally high in its case in both sub-periods at (-2.90%) and (-2.57%), respectively.\nV.17 Fibre Crops\nAmong the three major fibre crops, namely:\nJute\nMesta\nSunhemp\nJute gained in its relative share in area, forming 76.55% of the area under fibre crops in 1970-71, increasing to 81.45% in 1992-93, recording an annual rate of growth at 0.38% during this period. Shift in area was more prominent during the second sub-period with a trend rate of\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
