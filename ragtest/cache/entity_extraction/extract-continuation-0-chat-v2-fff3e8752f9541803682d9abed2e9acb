It is eighth in geographical spread among the states in the country. Physiographically, it is divided into three distinct regions:\nNorth Bihar: The most fertile part of the state, largely falling under the Gangetic plains. Topography is entirely plain with drainage from west to east submerging in the river Ganges.\nSouth Bihar: Also has plain topography, but its drainage emanating from the plateau region has a south to north direction, merging again into the Ganges.\nChhotanagpur Plateau Region: The largest in size, accounting for 46.0% of the state's geographical area. It is characterized by an undulating topography with several plateaus ranging from 300m to 1000m above sea level and valleys in between.\ni) Agro-Climatic Zones\nWhile demarcating the agro-climatic zones of the country, the Planning Commission categorized the districts of Bihar into two zones and three sub-zones:\nMiddle Gangetic Plains: This zone includes the sub-zone named North-East Alluvial, consisting of districts such as Aurangabad, Begusarai, Bhagalpur, Darbhanga, Gaya, Gopalganj, Katihar, Khagaria, Madhepura, Madhubani, Munger, Muzaffarpur, Nalanda, Nawadah, West Champaran, Patna, East Champaran, Rohtas, Saharsa, Samastipur, Saran, Sitamarhi, Siwan, and Vaishali. This stretches from west to east in the northern plains as well as in the south-west parts of the state.\nEastern Plateau and Hills: This zone consists of two sub-zones:\nNorth Central Plateaus: With districts such as Deoghar, Dhanbad, Giridih, Gonda, Hazaribagh, Sahebganj, and Dumka.\nEastern Plateau: Consisting of districts such as Gumla, Lohardagga, Palamu, Ranchi, and Singhbhum.\nThe Rajendra Agricultural University, Pusa, however, classified the districts of Bihar into four comprehensive agro-climatic zones:\nTable 11.1\nAgro-Climatic Zonewise Distribution of Districts in Bihar\nii) Climate\nThe climate of the state is characterized by hot summers, wet monsoons, and dry cool winters, with maximum temperatures reaching above 45°C in June and minimum temperatures dropping below 5°C in January.\nThe climatic condition of the north-east alluvial sub-zone, as defined by the Planning Commission, is dry sub-humid to moist sub-humid with average annual rainfall at 1470 mm, mostly falling during the monsoon season from mid-June to September-October, often causing severe floods, especially in the upper reaches.\nIn the north-central plateau sub-zone, the climate varies between moist sub-humid and dry sub-humid, with average annual rainfall at 1296 mm, which is slightly less than the north-east alluvial sub-zone.\nThe climate of the eastern plateau is temperate, with mercury rising as high as 45°C in June. Although the average rainfall is similar to the north-central plateau, it is highly erratic, causing frequent drought conditions.\niii) Dependence on Rainfall\nWith only 43.7% of the net irrigated area, and that too having a low intensity of use at 125%, the agriculture of Bihar depends heavily on rainfall. However, the pattern of rainfall has been highly erratic in recent years, with either excessive rainfall causing floods, especially in North Bihar, or deficient rainfall aggravating drought conditions, particularly in the central and plateau regions of the state. The delayed arrival of the monsoon and wide inter-spell fluctuations have also been intermittent in the preceding few decades. Deficiency in rainfall, both in the plateau and plain regions of the state, has been a common feature with wide year-to-year fluctuations. Details can be seen from Table 11.2.\n\nTable 11.2\nSeason-wise Rainfall in Bihar\n(Rainfall in mm)\nNote: Figures in brackets indicate the deficiency/sufficiency of rainfall in percentage.\n\niv) Hydrological Set-up\n11.8 Hydrological set-up of a state/region becomes important in as much as it adds and augments the productive quality of the land. The state of Bihar is rich in respect of both mineral and hydrologically rich formations. The entire plain tract, i.e., 54.0% of the state's area, is floating on ground-water resources. The plateau region, on the other hand, has abundant mineral resources of high commercial value. The general geological succession obtaining in the state could be described as shown in Table 11.3.\n11.9 Hydrologically, the state can be divided into four domains, namely:\n(a) Main alluvial basins\n(b) Marginal alluvial terrain\n(c) Hard rock terrain\n(d) Soft rock areas\nThe main alluvial basins vary in thickness from 20-30 m in the plateau region to nearly 2500 m in the north plain. It forms a single but heterogeneous aquifer system. Aquifers are available in abundance in both shallow and deep layers,\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India stretched between latitudes 27°-31°N and longitudes 88°-18°E to 83°-20°E, with a total geographical area of 1.74 lakh square km, divided into North Bihar, South Bihar, and the Chhotanagpur Plateau Region, characterized by diverse topographies and climatic zones)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORTH BIHAR<|>GEO<|>The most fertile part of Bihar, falling under the Gangetic plains with a plain topography and drainage submerging in the river Ganges)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTH BIHAR<|>GEO<|>Part of Bihar with plain topography, where drainage emanating from the plateau region merges into the Ganges)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHHOTANAGPUR PLATEAU REGION<|>GEO<|>Largest region in Bihar, accounting for 46.0% of the state's geographical area, characterized by an undulating topography with plateaus and valleys)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIDDLE GANGETIC PLAINS<|>GEO<|>Agro-climatic zone in Bihar including districts like Aurangabad, Begusarai, and Patna, stretching from west to east in the northern plains and in the south-west parts of the state)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EASTERN PLATEAU AND HILLS<|>GEO<|>Agro-climatic zone in Bihar consisting of districts like Gumla, Lohardagga, and Ranchi, characterized by a temperate climate and frequent drought conditions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAJENDRA AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, PUSA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>University that classified the districts of Bihar into four comprehensive agro-climatic zones)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIMATE OF BIHAR<|>EVENT<|>Characterized by hot summers, wet monsoons, and dry cool winters, with temperatures ranging from above 45°C in June to below 5°C in January, and varying rainfall patterns causing floods and droughts)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NORTH BIHAR<|>BIHAR<|>North Bihar is a region within the state of Bihar, known for its fertility and plain topography<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOUTH BIHAR<|>BIHAR<|>South Bihar is a region within the state of Bihar, with plain topography and unique drainage patterns<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHHOTANAGPUR PLATEAU REGION<|>BIHAR<|>The Chhotanagpur Plateau Region is the largest region within Bihar, known for its undulating topography<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIDDLE GANGETIC PLAINS<|>BIHAR<|>The Middle Gangetic Plains are an agro-climatic zone within Bihar, including several districts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EASTERN PLATEAU AND HILLS<|>BIHAR<|>The Eastern Plateau and Hills are an agro-climatic zone within Bihar, known for its temperate climate and drought conditions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAJENDRA AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, PUSA<|>BIHAR<|>The Rajendra Agricultural University, Pusa, has contributed to the classification of Bihar's agro-climatic zones<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLIMATE OF BIHAR<|>BIHAR<|>The climate of Bihar significantly affects its agriculture and living conditions, with variations causing floods and droughts<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
