Rates of child malnutrition, as reflected in stunting, wasting, and underweight, are significantly higher in the poorest wealth quintiles and decrease as household incomes increase (Figure 2.3). One of the factors that has been identified as an immediate cause of poor nutritional outcomes is the intake of a diet that lacks enough calories and micronutrients. A diet that lacks key micronutrients makes individuals vulnerable to conditions like anemia and manifests in children as stunting and wasting. Conversely, a diet that is based on an excessive intake of calories and inadequate micronutrients can lead to overnutrition, as reflected in obesity.\nIn line with the evolution of global thinking around food security, target SDG2.1 calls specifically to “ensure access by all people, in particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations, including infants, to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year round.” Bihar, as well as the rest of India, is faced with the triple burden of malnutrition—undernutrition, overnutrition, and micronutrient deficiencies. SDG2 calls to end all these forms of malnutrition.\n\n2.1 Child Malnutrition\nChild malnutrition is one of the most important development challenges in India. This is particularly true for Bihar, which has one of the highest rates of child malnutrition in the country. Malnourished children face a greater risk of mortality during their childhood. A poor nutritional status during childhood also affects outcomes and abilities later in life. Children who are poorly nourished may be faced with lower cognitive skills, poor educational outcomes, and reduced incomes as adults. For girls, in particular, poor childhood nutrition can have negative implications for the course of their future pregnancies and the health of their babies, resulting in a cycle of malnutrition that is transmitted across generations.\nAs of the latest estimation of 2018–19, a little more than 40 percent of children under the age of 5 were stunted (low height-for-age) and underweight (low weight-for-age), and slightly more than one-fifth were wasted (low weight-for-height). These rates of malnutrition are higher than those for the country (Figure 2.4). Although the prevalence of stunting, wasting, and underweight did decline from 2005–15, the gains have been slow, and there was a recent increase in stunting and wasting between 2016 and 2019.\nFigure 2.5 | Prevalence of child malnutrition in Bihar, by district (2019-20)\nData source: NFHS-5 (2019–20)\na) Stunting\nb) Underweight\nc) Wasting\nFigure 2.6 | Prevalence of anemia in children (6-59 months) in Bihar, by district\nData source: NFHS-5 (2019–20)\nThere is considerable variation in the distribution of malnutrition among children across the state. The high overall rates for stunting are reflected by the fact that, in most districts, the rates are at least 47 percent. The prevalence of underweight and wasting in children is greater in the southern districts, as compared to the north. The spatial distribution shows that some districts are burdened with high rates of multiple types of child malnutrition. For instance, in the southern districts, like Gaya, Arwal, Patna, Banka, and Jamui, the prevalence of all three—stunting, underweight, and wasting—are very high.\nChildren in Bihar also suffer from high rates of micronutrient deficiencies, known as hidden hunger. In every district of the state, at least 50 percent of the children below the age of 5 are anemic (Figure 2.6), and most of the districts have shown an increased number of anemic children in the past three years. In the state overall, a little less than 70 percent of children are anemic. Interestingly, the increased rates of anemia are seen even when there is an improvement in the number of pregnant women consuming iron and folic acid supplements, which jumped from 10 to 18 percent between 2015–16 and 2019–20. In addition to anemia, approximately 20 percent of children in the state are deficient in vitamin A, vitamin D, and zinc. Other prominent deficiencies prevalent among children are vitamin B12 (13.8 percent) and folate in blood (6.1 percent).\n\n2.2 Nutritional Status of Women\nWomen’s nutritional status is the pillar around which the nutritional status of the household is built. There is strong evidence pointing to the important role of maternal health in ensuring better nutritional outcomes for children. At the same time, women’s health status determines their ability to take care of their children, work and earn income, and allocate time to domestic tasks like food preparation and consumption. In Bihar, a little over a third of women have a low body mass index (BMI). There is spatial variation, however. In districts like Araria and Purnea, 40 percent of women have low BMI, while in districts like Bhojpur and Saran, the prevalence is 25 percent (Figure 2.9).\nAnemia is a public health concern in India. The condition can result in maternal mortality, weakness, diminished physical and mental capacity, increased morbidity from infectious diseases, perinatal mortality, premature delivery, and low birthweight. Though the share of anemic women in Bihar had declined from 68 to 60 percent between 2006 and 2016, the latest 2020 NFHS data indicate an increase in the past three years. The data also show that the initial decline was not sustainable, and the prevalence of anemia continues to be high, with\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India facing significant challenges with child malnutrition, anemia among children and women, and variations in nutritional status across its districts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SDG2.1<|>EVENT<|>A target under the Sustainable Development Goals aiming to ensure access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food for all people, especially the poor and vulnerable)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NFHS-5<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The National Family Health Survey for the year 2019-20, providing data on health and nutrition in India)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>SDG2.1<|>Bihar's nutritional challenges are directly relevant to the aims of SDG2.1, which seeks to end malnutrition<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>NFHS-5<|>The NFHS-5 provides crucial data on the nutritional status of children and women in Bihar, highlighting the state's health challenges<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
