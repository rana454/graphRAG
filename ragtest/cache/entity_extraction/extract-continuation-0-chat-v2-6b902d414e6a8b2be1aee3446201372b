Even Katihar, which showed negative growth performance during the first sub-period, took a positive turn, growing at 2.81% per annum. Begusarai and Bhagalpur also showed modest increases at 3.92% and 3.48% respectively.\nc) South-West Alluvial Plains\n111.10 Districts falling under this zone showed homogeneity in growth rates of foodgrain production during 1977-91. Nawadah was an exception with the least growth rate at 1.11% only. Other districts, namely Aurangabad (2.95%), Bhojpur (3.29%), Gaya (2.62%), Nalanda (2.98%), Patna (1.55%), and Rohtas (2.34%) had growth rates much higher than the state average. The growth rates in these districts accelerated to a higher level during the second sub-period. A homogeneous tract comprising of districts such as Patna, Nalanda, and Nawadah experienced spectacular growth rates. The growth rate in Nawadah was more significant as it lagged far behind during the first sub-period (-4.84%), but increased to 13.1% during the second sub-period. Aurangabad and Rohtas had modest growth rates at 3.15% and 3.65% respectively during this period.\nd) Plateau Districts\n111.11 Of the seven districts falling in this zone, five districts experienced a decline in the production of foodgrains (0.5% to more than 1.0%) during 1977-91. Of the remaining districts, Hazaribagh showed positive growth (1.59%) which exceeded even the state average. Giridih showed a mere 0.76% growth during this period. The scenario changed during the second sub-period with a notable rise in production in the plateau districts at 3.27%. The districts of Hazaribagh (4.67%) and Palamu (4.52%) exhibited a high degree of growth rate. Even the districts such as Giridih and Dumka experienced positive growth rates of 3.38% and 2.15% respectively during the second sub-period. The improved scenario during the second sub-period was a notable feature of the plateau districts.\n\nZone-wise/District-wise Analysis\n111.22 Over the period from 1977-91, there was an increase in the yield of foodgrains across all zones, though at varying rates. The north-west alluvial plains experienced the highest rate of increase in yield at 2.82%, while the plateau districts had the lowest at 0.96%. For the north-west alluvial plains and east alluvial plains, the rate of increase in yield was similarly high, with annual growth rates of 2.75% and 2.92% respectively. The increase in yield levels began around the mid-eighties in all zones. During the first sub-period, the yield trend increased only in the north-west alluvial plains (1.02%), while the east alluvial plains, south-west alluvial plains, and plateau districts showed declining trends in the range of (-)0.91% to (-)1.58%. In the second sub-period, the trend reversed and accelerated in all four agro-climatic zones, with growth rates ranging from 3.57% to 3.95%. The plateau districts, in particular, saw a notable acceleration in yield from a declining trend of (-)1.58% during the first sub-period to an increasing trend of 3.95% in the second sub-period. Districts showing relatively high growth rates in yield were not necessarily those with high volumes of foodgrains production. Some districts with lesser foodgrains production also showed high growth rates in yield, including East Champaran, Saran, Madhubani, Vaishali, and Aurangabad.\n\nFactors Influencing Growth Performance of Agriculture\n111.23 The preceding discussion indicates that agriculture in Bihar, particularly foodgrains, experienced accelerating growth rates from 1984-93. With a decline in area, the growth was largely driven by increases in yield. To ascertain the factors influencing yield increases, a set of factors such as fertilizer consumption per gross cropped hectare, percentage of HYV (High-Yielding Varieties) area, percentage of gross irrigated area to gross cropped area, and percentage deviation of actual rainfall from normal rainfall were regressed on the value of agricultural output per gross cropped hectare for the period from 1976-77 to 1990-91. Details of the methodology for obtaining the value of agricultural output are presented in the methodology section of Chapter-I. Fertilizer consumption and area under HYV seeds were identified as the most significant inputs influencing agricultural yield in Bihar. Irrigation, which remained almost stagnant during the period, did not significantly affect yield levels. Normal rainfall during the period contributed to agricultural growth with stability in the state.\n\nConclusions\n111.24 The study suggests the following broad conclusions:\nThe growth performance of foodgrains production in Bihar stagnated until 1982-83.\nAn upward trend began from 1983-84. The growth rate during 1984-93 in Bihar was comparable to agriculturally developed states like Punjab and Haryana, but lagged behind West Bengal.\nThe increase in foodgrains production was primarily due to rabi foodgrains, as kharif foodgrains production continued to stagnate, similar to the national trend.\nBoth area and yield contributed to the increase in rabi foodgrains production during the late eighties.\nThe impact of yield on\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MUNGER<|>GEO<|>One of the districts in the zone showing growth rates exceeding 5.0% during the period)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PURNIA<|>GEO<|>One of the districts in the zone showing growth rates exceeding 5.0% during the period)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAHARSA<|>GEO<|>One of the districts in the zone showing growth rates exceeding 5.0% during the period)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KATIHAR<|>GEO<|>District that showed negative growth performance during the first sub-period but grew at 2.81% per annum later)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEGUSARAI<|>GEO<|>District showing modest increases at 3.92%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BHAGALPUR<|>GEO<|>District showing modest increases at 3.48%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAWADAH<|>GEO<|>District with the least growth rate at 1.11% during 1977-91 but increased to 13.1% during the second sub-period)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AURANGABAD<|>GEO<|>District with growth rates of 2.95% during the first sub-period and 3.15% during the second)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BHOJPUR<|>GEO<|>District with a growth rate of 3.29%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAYA<|>GEO<|>District with a growth rate of 2.62%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NALANDA<|>GEO<|>District with a growth rate of 2.98%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PATNA<|>GEO<|>District with a growth rate of 1.55%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROHTAS<|>GEO<|>District with a growth rate of 2.34% during the first sub-period and 3.65% during the second)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAZARIBAGH<|>GEO<|>District showing positive growth of 1.59% during the first sub-period and 4.67% during the second)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GIRIDIH<|>GEO<|>District showing a growth of 0.76% during the first sub-period and 3.38% during the second)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PALAMU<|>GEO<|>District with a high degree of growth rate at 4.52% during the second sub-period)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUMKA<|>GEO<|>District experiencing positive growth rates of 2.15% during the second sub-period)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EAST CHAMPARAN<|>GEO<|>District with high growth rates in yield)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SARAN<|>GEO<|>District with high growth rates in yield)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MADHUBANI<|>GEO<|>District with high growth rates in yield)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VAISHALI<|>GEO<|>District with high growth rates in yield)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NAWADAH<|>AURANGABAD<|>Both districts showed significant improvement in growth rates during the second sub-period<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAZARIBAGH<|>PALAMU<|>Both districts exhibited a high degree of growth rate during the second sub-period<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GIRIDIH<|>DUMKA<|>Both districts experienced positive growth rates during the second sub-period<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EAST CHAMPARAN<|>SARAN<|>Both districts showed high growth rates in yield, indicating a similar agricultural performance<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MADHUBANI<|>VAISHALI<|>Both districts showed high growth rates in yield, indicating a similar agricultural performance<|>2)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
