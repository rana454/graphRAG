Districts where land consolidation was implemented even partially showed lower increases in the number of operational holdings.\niv) Over and above the land ceiling, the state had a large estimated surplus land of around 731.0 thousand hectares.\nv) The high fragmentation of land holdings, often 15-20 parcels, posed a bigger problem for the state in the dissemination of technology and called for urgent land consolidation.\nvi) The land lease market was all pervasive in the State, forming nearly 50-60% of the total operational holdings.\nvii) The dominant form of lease was oral tenancy (97%), mostly with crop-sharing arrangements.\nviii) The menace of absentee cultivation was still sharp, forming around 15.0% of the operational holdings. This chunk of land remained out of the gamut of farm investment as a result of indifferent attitudes of the landowners and the inability of the lessee to raise funds for investments.\n\nBibliography\nBardhan, Pranab K.
