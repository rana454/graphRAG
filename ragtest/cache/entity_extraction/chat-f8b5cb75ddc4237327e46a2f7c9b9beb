The estimated capacity needed is 12.61 lakh metric tonnes, against which 6.98 lakh metric tonnes was in existence at the beginning of the year 2016-17. The plan is to make good the shortfall of 5.63 lakh metric tonnes during 2016-17 and to add a further capacity of 60,000 metric tonnes every year up to 2020-21.\n\n\nEconometric Analysis\n\nSeveral supply-side factors influence agricultural growth, such as technology (seed replacement rate, irrigation, fertilizer use, farm mechanization, extension, etc.), incentives (terms of trade), rural infrastructure (electricity, roads), and climatic conditions. However, it is difficult to analyze the effects of all the variables in a single framework, both due to lack of availability of data and the fact that many of these variables can be associated. Therefore, we use a simple model to determine the potential drivers of growth.\n\nCorrelation Matrix\n\nIt is observed that GDPA shows a significant and positive correlation with irrigation, certified seed use and fertilizer consumption, diversification towards milk, terms of trade, and road density.\n\nEstimating the Equation\n\nThe logarithmic value of GDPA is the dependent variable and the variables mentioned above are our explanatory variables. In the analysis, we have used data from 2000-01 to 2012-13 and have run varying specifications of the model by using different variables and have finally presented only those variables that have a significant effect on agriculture GDP. Based on this exercise, the following static models were estimated in Model 1 and Model 2 (Table 36).\n\n Irrigation, terms of trade, and the milk sector have a significant and positive effect on agricultureâ€™s share in GDP. The three independent variables together explain around 86 percent of the variation in agricultural GDP for the studied period. Since we have estimated a double log model, the results in Model 1 indicate that, ceteris paribus, a one percent growth in the irrigation ratio increases agriculture growth by 1.5 percent. Bihar has substantial potential to increase surface water irrigation. Currently, Bihar has achieved only 53.7 percent of total ultimate potential through major and medium projects and 46.7 percent of minor surface flow irrigation. \n\nSimilarly, Table 36 shows that, all else being equal, a one percent improvement in the terms of trade in favor of agriculture increases agricultural GDP by 0.9 percent. Price policy plays a very important role in driving the agriculture sector. Remunerative prices in the open market help farmers make informed decisions on cropping and also encourage farmers to undertake higher investments. Currently, procurement of food grains from Bihar is low compared to states like Punjab due to poor marketing infrastructure; this has affected the market price of food grains, which is lower than the minimum support prices (MSP). Bihar contributed around 6.1 percent of total rice production in TE 2013-14, but only 3.7 percent of total production was procured by the government (CACP). In comparison, Punjab and Haryana produce around 11 percent and 3.9 percent of total rice production in India respectively, while the government procures around 24.2 percent from Punjab and 7 percent from Haryana. Therefore, it is important that Bihar strengthens its marketing infrastructure and procurement system to levels prevailing in Haryana and Punjab to correct the perpetual bias in procurement and to ensure that farmers in the state can avail of the benefits of the pricing policy (MSP) and increase their ability to incur higher investment and adopt new technologies.\n\nFinally, Model 1 shows that, all else being equal, a one percent increase in the share of milk in the total value of output from agriculture and allied activities will increase agriculture growth by 0.3 percent.\n\nIn Model 2, we show that roads and terms of trade in favor of agriculture have a significant and positive effect on agricultural GDP. The two independent variables together explain around 78 percent of the variation in agricultural GDP. As in the case of Model 1, the second model can be interpreted as follows. Ceteris paribus, a one percent growth in road density increases agriculture growth by 1.2 percent and a one percent growth in terms of trade (in favor of agriculture) increases agriculture growth by 0.4 percent. Roads play a very important role in overall agricultural development. It is the only means through which farmers are connected to both output and input markets. However, it is not enough to just increase road density. The government needs to increase surfaced road density, which is only 47.2 percent of total roads in Bihar.\n\nStationarity and Co-integration\n\nIt is important to note that time series data have a common tendency of growing over time. If we ignore this tendency of two or more sequences trending in the same or opposite direction, we can erroneously conclude that changes in one variable are actually caused by changes in another variable. In many cases, two time series processes appear to be correlated only because they are both trending over time for reasons related to other unobserved factors (Wooldridge, 2009). In other words, we need to account for unobserved, trending factors that affect the dependent variable and can also be correlated with the explanatory variables. If we ignore this possibility, we may find a spurious relationship between our\n\nFarm Harvest Price vs. Minimum Support Price\n\nThe farm harvest price (FHP) of rice and wheat has been significantly lower than the Minimum Support Price (MSP) consistently over a long period for both wheat and paddy. It is a matter of concern that the deviation between the FHP and MSP for both paddy and wheat has increased in recent years. The average price difference between the MSP and FHP for the period 2008-09 to 2013\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
