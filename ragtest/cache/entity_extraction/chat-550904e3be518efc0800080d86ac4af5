Agricultural productivity in Bihar was much better compared to other states in the 1950s but is now much below the national average. In the last two years, there has been appreciable growth due to improved seeds, technologies, and inputs, but there is still a long way to go to achieve responsive agriculture. This would require infrastructure, technology, and inputs. R&D has a vital role to play. There is inequitable distribution of water for irrigation, inadequate number of shallow tube-wells, ineffective use of rainwater, and lack of conjunctive use of different irrigation waters, which are areas of concern.\nThere is almost no system of organic farming, which has tremendous prospects for accelerated agricultural productivity. Urgent attention is needed in this area. Moreover, the Tal and Diara lands can only be irrigated by overhead sprinklers, but farmers in Bihar do not own overhead sprinklers due to their poor economic status. The quantity and quality of the use of inputs, such as fertilizers and seeds, in the state are also far below the desired level. Considering that quality seed is fundamental to the establishment of a productive system, the highly unsatisfactory status of availability of quality seed (seeds, quality planting material, fingerlings, and semen) to the farmers is one of the most serious concerns in Bihar. Moreover, institutional support in terms of hassle-free, timely, and adequate credit and agricultural insurance are also much below the requirement. A large number of small and marginal farmers are not part of the institutional farm credit system. This needs urgent attention. The farm gate price of most commodities is low, which means farmers do not get remunerative prices. Departments of Agriculture, Floriculture, Animal Husbandry, Fisheries, and Sugarcane are not geared up to take technologies to the field. Similarly, the Agriculture University in the state is not well equipped to address these issues. Overall institutional arrangements and the entire farm-related delivery mechanism are very weak and need urgent attention.\nAgriculture is the single largest private sector occupation in Bihar and can be considered the riskiest business. Hence, the goal of the agricultural production system should be to maximize the income of land-owning and landless rural populace to improve their livelihoods. The vulnerability to income and consumption shocks makes it imperative to develop formal agricultural insurance mechanisms to cope with such risks. The traditional yield insurance schemes have failed in managing the risks of poor farmers as evidenced by their historically high payouts and poor penetration rates. There is a need to develop effective risk management strategies to cover potential losses in yield and hence incomes.\nTo achieve the desired levels of productivity, immediate steps are needed to improve infrastructure – such as power, rural roads, and marketing in particular – and arrange for the supply of quality seeds, balanced use of fertilizers, adequate machinery, required changes in land policy, a farmer-friendly extension service, and an effective credit delivery system in keeping with the adequate credit absorptive capacity of the farmers in Bihar. All these could provide a bright future for Bihari farmers.\nB. Recommendations\nGiven the low average yields of most commodities, the huge gaps between the demonstrated and generally realized yields, the low farmers’ income, and widespread rural poverty on one hand, and the richness of the natural resources and the socio-political expediency to liberate the people of Bihar from poverty and hunger on the other, business as usual will not yield the desired results. A holistic system-based approach is needed to simultaneously enhance productivity, profitability, equity, and environmental sustainability through synergistically integrating crop, cash crop, horticulture, livestock, fisheries, agroforestry, watershed-based soil and water management, social capital formation, agro-processing, and marketing in an end-to-end mode. Under a decision support system, the problems and their solutions must be disaggregated as per the location-specific resources, needs, and aspirations, calling for synergy among research, technology, extension, farmer, community-based organizations, markets, and public policy. All these would turn Bihar’s challenges into opportunities and help Bihar to emerge as the \"Granary of India\". Bihar’s aim must be to realize 5-6% annual agricultural growth in order to sustain its overall economy.\nThe Key Recommendations for Accelerated Agricultural Development in Bihar are as follows:\nBridging the Existing Yield Gaps\n\nThe gap between the state average productivity and potential is very high due to technology adoption and inputs. Therefore, bridging the existing yield gaps by making adequate availability of quality seeds and other technical inputs to farmers would be the first and foremost requirement for improvement of crop productivity. Crop-specific and zone-specific strategies should be adopted at the farmer level to derive maximum benefit. Bihar needs specific development strategies for North and South regions of the state.\nThere should be a specific program to multiply the best quality breeder seeds and distribute them to farmers. The Seed Corporation should be revamped, and another agency on the pattern of Tarai Seed, 'Pusa Beej' should be started. This will not only help the availability of seeds to the farmers but also seed sector could become one of the enterprises. The Seed Village concept should also be encouraged by providing breeder seed and technological inputs. Successful experiments have been conducted in Bihar under Zero Tillage, Bed Planting, System of Rice Intensification (SRI), and Site-Specific Nutrient Management Systems. Besides, efforts should be made to promote contract farming in maize and certain horticultural crops for which the state has huge potential. Dairy Cooperatives being a success in Bihar need further support for expansion and to enhance the health and productivity of livestock. There should be further expansion and revitalization of the fisheries and poultry sectors, which hold high potential, particularly in light of changing consumption patterns.\nEfficient Use of Modern Inputs and Balanced Use of Fertilizers\n\nEff\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
