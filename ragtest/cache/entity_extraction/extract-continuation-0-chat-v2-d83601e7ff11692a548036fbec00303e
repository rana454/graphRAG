Training programs will be organized in batches of 25 dealers per district.\n   * Providing Organic/Chemical Inputs to Farmers at Subsidized Rates: To promote integrated pest and disease management, inputs will be provided at subsidized rates under plant protection schemes. This includes organic/chemical inputs, pheromone traps, sticky traps, etc. Provision has been made for recurring expenditure every year.\n   * Analysis for Quality of Pesticides and Biological Pesticides: Currently, there is no testing system for biopesticides in Bihar, leading to samples being sent outside the state for testing, which incurs high costs and delays. The current testing facility can only handle 87 samples.\nQuality Control of Pesticides\nAnalysis of Pesticides in the State:\nQuality Control Laboratory, Mithapur, and Patna handle the analysis of pesticides in the state. As of October 1, 2022, there are 318 insecticides registered under Section 9(3) of the Insecticides Act, 1968. Due to inadequate testing facilities, not all pesticide samples sold in the state are being taken and tested. Adequate financial outlay has been provided for testing all kinds of pesticides. To ensure the quality of pesticides, samples for testing will be sent to:\n* Quality Control Laboratory, Mithapur, Patna\n* Indian Agricultural Research Institute affiliated institute\n* National Institute of Plant Health Management (NIPHM), Hyderabad\n* Bihar Agricultural University Sabour, Bhagalpur\n* Dr. Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University, Pusa, Samastipur\n* Other identified Bio-Products Testing Laboratories\nModernization and Renovation of Plant Protection Office:\n* Necessary furniture, accounting materials, computers, and computer operators on a contract basis will be provided to:\n   * Joint Director, Plant Protection\n   * Divisional Deputy Director, Plant Protection\n   * Assistant Director posted in the district\n* Vehicles on a monthly hire basis will be ensured.\n* A provision has been made for recurring expenditure on this every year.\nExposure Visit / Training:\n* Officials of Plant Protection will be trained at the National Institute of Plant Health Management (NIPHM), Hyderabad, and other training institutes for knowledge enhancement and capacity building.\n* Through exposure visits, Plant Protection officials will learn about advanced technology-based crop protection programs adopted in other states, enhancing their knowledge.\nBihar Organic Promotion Program\nIntroduction:\nInjudicious and incessant use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides has adversely affected human health and the environment. Around 30 percent of food produced worldwide gets wasted. Approximately 1 million species are threatened with extinction. Unsustainable agriculture attributes to biodiversity loss, contributing to global warming, contaminating soil, and threatening rural livelihoods as well as food and nutrition security. The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report showed that our food systems are estimated to cause up to 29% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.\nOne of the major causes of Nitrous Oxide emission is crop production and the use of chemicals in daily life. Due to various schemes of the Govt. of Bihar, such as the construction of vermicompost units, green manuring, and training and capacity building of farmers, there has been an inclination towards the adoption of Organic Farming among farmers, leading to emerging markets for organic produce.\nAchievements of Last Three Agricultural Roadmaps:\nIn the last three agricultural roadmaps, various government schemes for the promotion of organic farming have been successfully implemented. The major achievements include:\n* Construction of 786,604 Pucca Vermi Units\n* 179,369 HDPE vermin units\n* 614 pre-fabricated Vermicompost units\n* Promotion of 4,568 Jaivik Grams\n* 852,558 quintals of vermicompost distribution\n* 13,241 units of Gobar gas\n* 86 Commercial Vermicompost units\n* 23 Commercial bio-fertilizer units\n* Bio-fertilizer distribution for 936,487 ha\n* Dhaincha seed distribution for 1,814,053 ha\n* Seed Treatment for 90,326 ha\n* Pheromone Trap application in 35,489 ha\n* Bio-pesticide application in 44,691 ha\n* 800 units of seed drums distributed\nJaivik Corridor Yojna:\nIn Phase-1, Jaivik Corridor Yojna was rolled out in 2019 under the State Plan, identifying 13 districts: Bhagalpur, Begusarai, Bhojpur, Katihar, Khagaria, Buxar, Lakhisarai, Patna, Munger, Nalanda, Samastipur, Saran, and Vaishali. Currently, 187 groups/FPOs have been formed and are in the process of 2nd-year conversion (C2), involving 21,119 farmers covering 17,507 acres under NPOP through third-party certification from Bihar State Seed and Organic Certification Agency (BSSOCA). Detailed Agronomic Practices for Organic Cultivation for different crops have been prepared. All documentation works for certification and updating of TRACENET data have been completed within the stipulated timeframe. Input suppliers and distribution of organic inputs have been empaneled. By fulfilling all statutory requirements under the Societies & Companies Act, 187 FPOs have been promoted. 27 local points of sale have been made operational for:\n* Availability of organic inputs and organic pesticides at the local level\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PLANT PROTECTION CENTERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Centers responsible for training agricultural personnel in plant protection techniques)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Department overseeing agricultural activities and personnel training)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PESTICIDE DEALERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dealers providing pesticides to farmers, receiving training to increase their capacity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUALITY CONTROL LABORATORY, MITHAPUR, PATNA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Laboratory handling the analysis of pesticides in Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDIAN AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Institute affiliated for pesticide testing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF PLANT HEALTH MANAGEMENT (NIPHM), HYDERABAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Institute for training officials of Plant Protection and pesticide testing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY SABOUR, BHAGALPUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>University involved in pesticide testing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DR.
