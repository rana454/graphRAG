Over the years, it was not increasing either. The fall in net irrigated area by 1.04 lakh hectares for canal, 0.49 lakh hectares for tubewells, 1.62 lakh hectares for other wells, and 0.38 lakh hectares for tank/pond irrigation during 1977-91 was a serious cause of concern and called for necessary policy initiative to reverse such trends.\nIrrigation intensity was low at 122% in the state as against 180.0% in Punjab and 163.0% in Haryana. Districts with a high component of cash crops showed relatively high irrigation intensity. Prominent among these districts were Gopalganj (170.0%), Katihar (178.0%), and Purnea (161.0%).\nIrrigation was used mostly for food crops with their share at around 93.0% in 1990-91. Among the foodgrains, it was cereals (93.0%), and among cereal crops, it was paddy (46.0%), followed by wheat (40.0%) having a dominant share in irrigation. In the plateau zones, however, most of the irrigation was going to non-food crops. With elasticity of irrigation positive on yield, fertilizer consumption, crop intensity, and crop diversification, any development strategy aimed at output maximization called for further strengthening of the irrigation network in the state.\nHYV Seeds\nArea under HYV Seeds was expanding in the state with its significant influence on agricultural output. Across different zones/districts, the use of HYV seeds was positively correlated with irrigation. In terms of area coverage, however, it was much less as compared to the agriculturally developed states. HYV seeds were available for a restricted number of crops, that too under irrigated conditions. With almost half of the state under dryland, the available HYV package was quite inadequate for the state. Moreover, seed multiplication rate as well as replacement rate was low in the state. In addition to the poor supply network, the absence of proper storage facilities and multiplication of quality seeds were reported to be the major constraints in the state.\nFlow of Credit\nCredit Disbursement\nThere was a wide gap between credit requirements as estimated by various committees and actual credit flow in Bihar. In terms of credit available per hectare, it was just Rs. 312/- in Bihar as against Rs. 5,961/- in Kerala, Rs. 2,155/- in Tamil Nadu, and Rs. 1,189/- in Punjab in 1992-93. With cooperatives and Regional Rural Banks becoming redundant, the onus of credit disbursement seemed to be shared largely by commercial banks in the state. In the context of deposits increasing and advances remaining stagnant, their involvement, however, remained desirable.\nOperational Holdings and Tenancy Status\nLand Distribution and Tenancy\nThe state witnessed a fast increase in the number of operational holdings, thereby reducing the average size of holding and making them operationally non-viable. Skewness in land distribution continued to be serious in the state. High incidence (around 60%) of tenancy cultivation dominated largely by absentee landlords (estimated at around 16.60 lakh ha.) further choked the growth prospects, as such segment of land remained out of the investment gamut. High fragmentation of land (17-20 parcels on an average) was still worse, as it restricted and hindered the dissemination of modern technology in the state agriculture.\nChanging Land Use Pattern\nLand Use\nAvailability of agricultural land was low at 62.50% in Bihar as against 86.70% in Punjab and 68.10% in U.P. With high current fallow and culturable waste, the net sown area was still low at 45.20% only. The net sown area showed shrinkage at (-)0.79% per annum largely due to expanding current fallow, area under miscellaneous trees, and land under non-agricultural use. In some districts, increasing barren land also explained the declining net sown area. Shrinking net sown area with population increasing fast implied land-man ratio getting further adverse for agriculture in the state. Gross cropped area was declining more as a result of stagnant and inefficient irrigation.\nPolicy Implications\nPolicy Recommendations\nThe following policy recommendations are made to address the issues highlighted and enhance agricultural growth:\nWater Management: Implement area-specific plans for managing waterlogging and drainage. Develop plans to address barren land and soil erosion, particularly in plateau districts. Emphasize low-cost protective/supplemental irrigation.\nLand Management: Expedite land dispute resolutions. Increase R&D efforts for HYV seeds, especially for unirrigated conditions. Enhance seed multiplication and storage facilities. Include tenant cultivators in production credit schemes.\nInput Use: Promote the balanced use of fertilizer and enhance the use of compost. Ensure regular maintenance of irrigation investments and promote low-cost irrigation schemes.\nCredit Support: Amend credit norms and tenancy laws to support agricultural financing and growth. Address the gap between credit requirements and disbursement.\nFlow of Credit\nCredit Disbursement: There was a significant gap between the estimated credit requirements and actual credit flow. In 1992-93, credit per hectare in Bihar was much lower compared to states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Punjab.\nChallenges: With co-operatives and Regional Rural Banks facing issues, commercial banks became the primary credit source. Despite increased deposits, the credit flow remained stagnant, affecting agricultural investment.\nOperational Holdings and Tenancy Status\nLand Holdings: There was a rapid increase in the number of operational holdings, reducing the average size and making them less viable.\nTenancy\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
