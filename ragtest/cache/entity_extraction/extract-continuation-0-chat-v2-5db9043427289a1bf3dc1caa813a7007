In such a situation, the other alternative to maximize crop output is to raise more crops in different crop seasons on the same piece of land. In other words, it implies raising crop intensity of the land. In the context of declining net sown areas, raising crop intensity assumes more importance. Implicitly, crop intensity is influenced largely by favorable monsoons on the one hand and availability of modern technology, mainly irrigation, on the other. Over these years, there have been rapid strides in the expansion of improved technologies in Bihar agriculture as well. Before addressing the question of what the determinants of crop intensity are and whether it has kept pace with increasing use of modern technologies, it is more pertinent to examine how it varies across different agro-climatic zones/districts and what has been the trend in its growth over a period of time.\nVII.7 Crop intensity for Bihar was 136.1% in 1990-91. Over the years, it showed a marginal improvement in crop intensity from 129.0% in 1971-72 to 135.2% in 1981-82 and 136.1% in 1990-91. Compared to the all-India average of 130.4%, Bihar presents a better picture in crop intensity. However, in comparison to cropping intensity in states like Punjab (177.7%) and Haryana (165.4%), it is much less in Bihar. States such as West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, and Orissa were also ahead of Bihar with crop intensity at 162.5%, 147.3%, and 152.2% respectively. All these states gained in crop intensity in the range of 27.5% as in Orissa to 10.8% as in Uttar Pradesh, whereas in Bihar it improved by 5.5% only over the same period.\nVII.8 Across different agro-climatic zones/districts, the plateau districts showed relatively low crop intensity at 109% only. Among the alluvial plains, it was relatively high in the north-west zone (149%), followed by the east zone (143%). The south-west zone showed crop intensity at 140%. Analyzing crop intensity across different districts, it is observed that districts such as Darbhanga, Gopalganj, and Siwan in the north-west plains showed high crop intensity at 171%, 184%, and 165% respectively. Districts such as Muzaffarpur, Saran, and Vaishali had moderately high crop intensity ranging between 150% and 155%. It was, however, much less in Madhubani (134%) and East Champaran (128%).\nVII.9 Among the districts of the east alluvial plains, only Begusarai, Katihar, and Saharsa showed relatively high crop intensity at 155%, 161%, and 154% respectively. Bhagalpur and Munger, on the contrary, showed relatively low crop intensity at 122% and 123% respectively. Among the districts of the south-west alluvial plains, Rohtas alone showed crop intensity (150%) comparable to districts in the north-west and east alluvial plains. In other districts, it was modest in the range of 137% as in Patna and 144% as in Nalanda. Crop intensity among the districts of the plateau zone was dismally low in the range of 114% as in Hazaribagh and 103% as in Singhbhum.\nd) Area Sown More Than Once\nVII.10 Area sown more than once showed an increasing trend in most of the agro-climatic zones. It was increasing at 0.42% per annum in the north-west alluvial plains, 0.38% per annum in the east alluvial plains, and 1.09% per annum in the south-west alluvial plains. The plateau districts, on the contrary, showed a declining trend at (-)1.49% per annum. Amidst the general scenario of expanding area sown more than once, most of the districts in the north-west alluvial plains showed a declining trend. Such districts included Madhubani, Samastipur, Saran, Sitamarhi, Vaishali, and West Champaran. The rate of decline was as high as (-)1.90% in West Champaran and as low as (-)0.06% in Samastipur. Districts showing expansion in area sown more than once included Muzaffarpur (4.22%), Gopalganj (2.72%), Darbhanga (1.35%), East Champaran (0.81%), and Siwan (1.21%).\nVII.11 In the east alluvial plains, only Munger and Purnea showed a declining trend at (-)5.08% and (-)0.36% respectively. In all other districts, it showed expansion in the range of 4.12% per annum as in Begusarai and 0.44% as in Bhagalpur. Districts of the south-west alluvial plains, on the contrary, showed uniformity in the expansion of area sown more than once, increasing in the range of 1.89% as in Nalanda and 1.29% as in Gaya. The scenario among the districts of the plateau zone was different with some of the districts showing a high rate of decline. The rate of decline was as high as (-)9.22% in\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India that has shown marginal improvement in crop intensity over the years, presenting a better picture in crop intensity compared to the all-India average)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUNJAB<|>GEO<|>State in India with a high crop intensity of 177.7%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARYANA<|>GEO<|>State in India with a crop intensity of 165.4%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEST BENGAL<|>GEO<|>State in India with a crop intensity of 162.5%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UTTAR PRADESH<|>GEO<|>State in India with a crop intensity of 147.3%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORISSA<|>GEO<|>State in India with a crop intensity of 152.2%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DARBHANGA<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with high crop intensity at 171%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOPALGANJ<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with very high crop intensity at 184%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIWAN<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with high crop intensity at 165%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUZAFFARPUR<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with moderately high crop intensity ranging between 150% and 155%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SARAN<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with moderately high crop intensity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VAISHALI<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with moderately high crop intensity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MADHUBANI<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with crop intensity at 134%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EAST CHAMPARAN<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with crop intensity at 128%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEGUSARAI<|>GEO<|>District in the east alluvial plains of Bihar with relatively high crop intensity at 155%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KATIHAR<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with high crop intensity at 161%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAHARSA<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with relatively high crop intensity at 154%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BHAGALPUR<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar showing relatively low crop intensity at 122%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUNGER<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar showing relatively low crop intensity at 123%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROHTAS<|>GEO<|>District in the south-west alluvial plains of Bihar with crop intensity comparable to districts in the north-west and east alluvial plains at 150%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NALANDA<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with modest crop intensity in the range of 144%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PATNA<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with modest crop intensity at 137%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAZARIBAGH<|>GEO<|>District in the plateau zone of Bihar with low crop intensity at 114%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SINGHBHUM<|>GEO<|>District in the plateau zone of Bihar with very low crop intensity at 103%)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>PUNJAB<|>Bihar has less crop intensity compared to Punjab<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>HARYANA<|>Bihar has less crop intensity compared to Haryana<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>WEST BENGAL<|>Bihar has less crop intensity compared to West Bengal<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>UTTAR PRADESH<|>Bihar has less crop intensity compared to Uttar Pradesh<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>ORISSA<|>Bihar has less crop intensity compared to Orissa<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOPALGANJ<|>DARBHANGA<|>Gopalganj and Darbhanga are districts in Bihar with high crop intensity<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOPALGANJ<|>SIWAN<|>Gopalganj and Siwan are districts in Bihar with very high crop intensity<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DARBHANGA<|>SIWAN<|>Darbhanga and Siwan are districts in Bihar with high crop intensity<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MUZAFFARPUR<|>SARAN<|>Muzaffarpur and Saran are districts in Bihar with moderately high crop intensity<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MUZAFFARPUR<|>VAISHALI<|>Muzaffarpur and Vaishali are districts in Bihar with moderately high crop intensity<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SARAN<|>VAISHALI<|>Saran and Vaishali are districts in Bihar with moderately high crop intensity<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
