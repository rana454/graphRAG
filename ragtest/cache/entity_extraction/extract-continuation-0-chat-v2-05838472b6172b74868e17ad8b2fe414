The challenge, therefore, was to increase wheat production so that the farmer rediscovers agriculture as a remunerative occupation and then continues to contribute to the central food pool. Scientists involved with the project pointed out that during the successive years wheat sowing was getting delayed due to a number of factors, resulting in the wheat grains getting affected by the rise in the day temperature when they were just about maturing. As a result, the grains remained shriveled and weak, and even when it appeared that the crop was satisfactory, the end result fell much too short of expectations.\n 9. Disaster Risk Insurance: Some International Experiences\nThe world over, the concept of risk hedging frameworks has gained importance in the recent past. The examples for regions where the risk of natural disaster is calculated and hedged to a fair degree are in countries like Peru and Vietnam. The model developed for these geographies has been successful in using insurance as an effective risk hedging mechanism.\nOne interesting example is the Vietnam experience. Northern parts of Peru as well as the Mekong delta are flooded due to the effects of El Niño. Credit provisions are the most vulnerable in this situation due to increased default rates and higher liquidity risk (Skees and Barnett 2006).\nTo reduce the risk of default due to natural hazards, an index-based flood insurance product was developed and piloted in Vietnam by the national government in collaboration with the World Bank. The following are important examples across the globe where index-based risk transfer mechanisms have been implemented in severely disaster-prone geographies:\n(i) Vietnam: Early flooding in the Mekong Delta that is brought on by heavy rains upstream. In Vietnam, past practices of debt forgiveness following natural disasters have become unsustainable and recent changes to banking regulations are likely to lead to responses more similar to those in Bihar. The use of correlations between variables like natural phenomena and cultural helped in the development of the index (Barnett and Mahul 2007).\nThe target population is the agri-lenders and the contract payment structure involves a linear payment rate based on levels of water exceeding 250 cm at the prime river station (Tan Chau) with backup measures from stations upstream.\n(ii) Peru: Catastrophic flooding in the northern regions brought on by El Niño. In Peru, severe credit rationing has emerged as a mechanism banks employ to limit their financial exposure to correlated risk. The target group is the government and the entry of a reinsurer has spelled the lowering of risk on part of the insurer. The model uses the ENSO data and correlates the losses for agricultural produce. The government acts as the medium for risk transfer and relief distribution.\n(iii) Mongolia: Catastrophic Risk Insurance against severe winter (Dzud). An index-based livestock insurance scheme that has hedged the risk of rural people against the loss of livestock in times of extreme weather events like Dzud. This approach uses mortality rates based on species and geographical areas.\nMAJOR ISSUES RELATED TO AGRICULTURE SECTOR\nAgriculture is the core competence of the state. However, agriculture has performed badly, declining in the early 1990s by 2% per annum and growing by less than 1% per annum since 1994-95. Crop productivity trends have been below the Indian average for most crops and far below their potential yield, given Bihar’s fertile land and abundant water resources.\nThe critical production constraint to the rice-wheat production system in Bihar is the delay in seedling raising and transplanting of rice, and late sowing of wheat due to dependence on rice nursery raising and transplanting on rainwater or canal water (wherever available), and inadequate conjunctive use of groundwater, canal water, and rainwater. Even when a farmer owns a tube-well, he is reluctant to pump groundwater for nursery raising and transplanting of rice because of the excessive cost of pumping associated with the diesel engine operated pumping sets. Major production constraints are:\nLow Seed Replacement Rate\nSeeds of high-yielding varieties have been critical in increasing crop production. The dwarfing gene of rice and wheat did wonders in the 60s as these varieties were short stature and could respond well to fertilizer, irrigation, and other management practices. Development of hybrid varieties in many crops opened yet another opportunity to further increase crop production and productivity. Due to lack of assured supply of quality seed, crop productivity has suffered in the State.\nLow Level of Fertilizer Use\nFertilizers are the critical input in modern agriculture. The present level of fertilizer application is not only inadequate but also far from its balanced use. The present level of fertilizer application in the State is 98 kg/ha, whereas it is more than 175 kg/ha in Punjab and higher applications in other States.\nLack of Mechanization\nIn Punjab, there are 68 tractors per 1000 ha, whereas it is only 17 per 1000 ha in Bihar. Lack of proper and adequate mechanization hinders timely completion of agronomic operations. Therefore, it is important to promote farm mechanization from the point of view of better and timely land preparation and cultivation practices.\nLow Level of Credit Availability\nModern agriculture is capital-intensive. Lack of institutional credit hinders the process of technology adoption. There are 104 lakh farm holdings, whereas the number of Kisan Credit Cards is only 20 lakh, which is very low. A large number of farmers in Bihar are isolated from institutional credit sources. Even if some sources are available, the amount is inadequate and availability is not timely. This constrains farmers' adoption of technological practices.\nSmall & Fragmented Holdings\nLand holdings in Bihar are predominantly marginal farms with a high level of fragmentation. Of all the holdings, more than 90 percent are small and marginal farmers.
