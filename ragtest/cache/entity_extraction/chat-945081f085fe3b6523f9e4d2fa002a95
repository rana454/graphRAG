Women’s education and awareness can play an important role in influencing household behaviors in these areas. In rural Bihar, the Lohiya Swachch Bihar Abhiyan (LSBA) brings together the state government’s Lohiya Swachchta Yojana with the central government’s Swachch Bharath Mission (rural) to end open defecation. Since 2016, JEEViKA self-help groups have been implementing BCC campaigns to support the successful execution of the program.\nAgricultural Practices and Health\nWhile water and sanitation comprise the immediate health environment, hygiene in certain agricultural practices can also adversely affect nutrient absorption. A lack of adequate storage methods can affect food safety, as seen with the presence of toxins in improperly stored grains postharvest. In this respect, food safety measures, like the use of airtight storage bags, should be promoted. Similarly, agricultural practices that use excessive amounts of chemical fertilizers and pesticides can have negative effects on health if these chemicals leach from the soil and enter the drinking water supply. There are also occupational risks that result from the nature of crop cultivation itself. For example, workers on rice farms have to constantly bend for long periods of time and stand or squat in waterlogged paddy fields that are often contaminated with bacteria, fungi, and chemicals. Flooded fields are also breeding grounds for diseases like malaria, tetanus, and schistosomiasis, all of which can adversely affect nutrient absorption. Women’s exposure to extreme seasonal activities and stress while carrying out manual agricultural tasks can negatively impact their own nutritional status. It has also been associated with lower birthweight for babies in India and Bangladesh.\n7.3 Recommendations\nWASH factors influence the absorption of nutrients in the body once food is consumed by an individual. Any policy for achieving SDG2 and ending all forms of malnutrition needs to factor in the role of the health environment. The existing programs of the national and state government concerning drinking water and sanitation largely focus on infrastructure development, such as drinking water facilities and sanitation systems.\nData Source\nNational Health Profile of India, Central Bureau of Health Intelligence & National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare\nWater Infrastructure and Latrine Construction\nWater infrastructure under the NRDWP and latrine construction under the LBSA. These programs can also be bolstered by campaigns that highlight the importance of WASH for nutritional outcomes. Health and family welfare departments can collaborate with the JEEViKA groups to spread awareness on the need for behavior change around issues like handwashing and open defecation. Similarly, the education department can implement awareness campaigns at the school level. Efforts to expand piped water should accentuate the link between it and increased time for women to spend doing alternate activities. Finally, investment in areas of food safety, like airtight bags for storing food, is needed, as are steps to address occupational risks, such as disseminating information about and assistance for waterborne diseases. This will require convergence between the health department and the agriculture and extension departments to inform farmers, especially women, of associated risks.\nPolicy Convergence\nThe food systems approach for getting to zero hunger in Bihar, as outlined in this report, highlights the multisectoral nature of the state’s malnutrition problem. It brings to the fore the need for a coordinated set of policies that reflect the multidimensional nature of malnutrition, from agricultural policies and household access to diverse foods to intrahousehold food allocation and WASH.\nThe Bihar State Nutrition Action Plan (2019)\nThe Bihar State Nutrition Action Plan (2019) focuses on the convergent actions required to address the immediate, underlying, and basic causes of malnutrition in the state. It recognizes the roles that the Departments of Women and Child Development (WCD), Health and Family Welfare, Agriculture, Education, Food and Civil Supplies, and Drinking Water and Sanitation can play, individually, in addressing malnutrition through existing schemes like the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS), the National Health Mission, the Midday Meal Scheme, the Public Distribution System (PDS), the National Food Security Mission, and the Swachch Bharath Abhiyaan. A similar mapping of the various schemes/policies within each of these departments is also found in Bihar’s SDG Vision document. However, the current policy space lacks an explicit recognition of the need for convergence between these various departments.\nConvergence at the Level of Objectives\nConvergence at the level of objectives means that various departments work toward the same overarching goal of nutrition security. Thus far, the goals of food or nutrition security have been set in isolation, such as with the Department of Agriculture increasing the production of food grains or Poshan Abhiyaan reducing the prevalence of malnutrition. Given that SDG2 explicitly recognizes the role of agriculture for reducing hunger and malnutrition, what is required, first and foremost, is an incorporation of nutrition security as the broad objective for the various departments involved in agriculture and related fields. It could then be determined not just which aspect of nutrition security—doubling farmer incomes, improving productivity, empowering women, healthy environments—can be addressed by each department, but also how there can be synergies across departments. In practice, the nutrition-related activities of a department would feed into and reinforce the activities of other departments, and vice versa, empowering them all to better meet their nutrition-related goals. For this to work, a focus on nutrition security needs to be explicitly incorporated in the objectives and activities of the various government departments and ministries at both the central and state levels.
