It has the potential to not only transform Bihar’s agricultural sector but will be a key input into improving food security and poverty reduction. Agriculture is the main source of livelihood in Bihar, supporting nearly 74 percent of the workforce. However, its contribution to state GDP is declining and currently stands at 18.3 percent. Bihar is also one of the least urbanized states in India, with a very high incidence of rural poverty. It is also much further behind other states in the structural transformation process (See Figures 1-4).\nTowards Developing Diversified Food Systems in Bihar for Improving Nutritional Outcomes\nAndaleeb Rahman, Soumya Manjunath, Nikhil Raj, and Nikita Tiwari\nFigure 1.

Source: Directorate of Economics and Statistics, Government of Bihar.\nGains in agricultural productivity are the most essential lever for overall growth. Bihar could not benefit from the productivity achievements of the Green Revolution of the 1970s. In recognition of this fact, the government of Bihar has been actively promoting agricultural development in the state in recent times. An agricultural policy roadmap was launched in 2008 to reorient policy towards boosting growth in agriculture and its allied sectors, such as horticulture, animal husbandry, and dairy development. The challenge remains, however, in the institutionalization of a strategy that is cognizant of the role of agriculture for the wider economy and for structural transformation of the same.\nGrowth of agriculture and allied activities is imperative from the perspective of food security and the improvement of overall nutritional outcomes. However, a transformation of the food system in Bihar requires careful understanding of the interrelationships between agricultural production, food security, nutrition, and the environment. Policy needs to consider the existing socioeconomic realities and inherent agricultural risks, such as climatic threats, limited finance, unequal access to inputs and information, as well as the potential for market opportunities to modernize the food systems. In order to ensure that the food system is nutrition-sensitive, the Bihar Agricultural Roadmaps need to be supplemented with greater focus on farm health, rural public infrastructure, market reforms, technology transfer, and improvement in extension services to ensure an innovation-oriented, highly remunerative, nutritive-rich agricultural growth in the state.\nSustainable diversification of food production in Bihar is a challenge, but the potential for success is immense, given its surplus labor force, fertile Gangetic plains, well-connected rural roads, and active state support. Against this backdrop, the Tata–Cornell Institute (TCI) and the Asian Development Research Institute (ADRI) have identified the following avenues for a renewed approach for the design of nutrition-sensitive agricultural policies in the state.\nNeed for Agricultural Diversification and Promotion of High-Value Crops\nHigh levels of soil fertility, abundant water resources, and a favorable agroclimatic zone offer an enabling environment and, thus, an opportunity for diversifying the crop sector in Bihar. Cereals—rice and wheat—occupy around 85 percent of the cropping area in the state. Among the major food crops, in addition to cereals, vegetables comprise the largest share (Figure 5). Analysis of price trends in staples, based on data from the Commission on Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), suggests that the net returns to cultivation of staples have been the lowest. Rice yields in Bihar are lower compared to other rice-producing states, although Bihar seems to have a comparative yield advantage in growing pulses. The agricultural policy, however, is preoccupied with the promotion of production of staple food grains. Agricultural diversification towards non-staples and other high-value commodities, such as fruits and vegetables, needs to be encouraged, along with adequate market support to ensure commercial viability of the farms over the long run. Production of high-value agricultural products has economic benefits like greater farm profitability and reduction in poverty, especially for the small landholders. According to the Agricultural Census 2011, around 97 percent of the farmers in Bihar are classified as small and marginal. The criticality of diversification of agricultural production for rural prosperity needs no stronger argument. For fruits and vegetables grown in the state, linking farmers to the food value chain will be a key strategy for enhancing income, generating upstream and downstream employment, and reducing poverty.\nImportance of Livestock and Limiting Constraints\nAnimal husbandry is one of the key sectors in Bihar, in addition to crops and horticulture. The livestock sector contributes to approximately 28.5% of the value of output from agricultural and allied sector income, and one-fifth of the total rural incomes come from livestock rearing. Livestock production also provides large-scale employment to women and workers belonging to marginalized groups. Given the small landholding size and high rainfall dependency for crop production, animal husbandry is an important source of supplementary income for farmers in Bihar. Greater focus on increasing productivity of the livestock economy is essential for meeting the rising demand for livestock products and enhancing nutrition, while also ensuring greater rural incomes.\n\nProduction of Milk in Bihar\nIncrease in Milk Production\nProduction of milk in Bihar increased from 2.7 to 7.2 million metric tons between 2001–2 and 2013–14; however, milk productivity continues to lag behind other major milk-producing states in the country, such as Gujarat\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>Bihar is a state in India with a significant agricultural sector, supporting nearly 74 percent of its workforce but contributing only 18.3 percent to its GDP.
