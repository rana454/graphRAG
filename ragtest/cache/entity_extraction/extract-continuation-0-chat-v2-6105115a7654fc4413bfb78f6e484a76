A district-wise analysis shows that while the south-west plains had higher irrigation intensity at 158.14%, the east plains had relatively lower intensity at 119.62% and the plateau districts had the least irrigation intensity at 79.94%. The irrigation intensity showed an increasing trend in the south-west plains (0.66% p.a.), while it was declining in all other agro-climatic zones.\n(iii) The Role of Irrigation in Yield and Productivity\nIX.12 The role of irrigation in raising the level of yield is crucial. The period of study showed the yield rate in the state in respect of major crops such as paddy, wheat, and sugarcane to be far lower than that of Punjab and Haryana, but higher than that of Uttar Pradesh. The average productivity of paddy in Bihar was 13.5 quintals per hectare in 1992-93, compared to 29.9 quintals in Punjab, 26.8 quintals in Haryana, and 16.6 quintals in Uttar Pradesh. Similarly, the average yield of wheat was 11.0 quintals per hectare in Bihar compared to 27.4 quintals in Punjab, 22.4 quintals in Haryana, and 16.6 quintals in Uttar Pradesh. In the case of sugarcane, Bihar had an average yield of 67.6 quintals per hectare compared to 108.4 quintals in Uttar Pradesh and 110.6 quintals in Punjab. The significant low yield rates in Bihar could be attributed to low irrigation levels in the State, besides inadequate use of bio-chemical technology.\nIX.13 Though irrigation plays a significant role in raising productivity, the yield rate for the major crops showed an increasing trend over the period in all the agro-climatic zones. The highest rate of increase was observed in the east plains zone in respect of wheat (0.85%), and sugarcane (1.21%) yield. The south-west plains showed an increasing trend in productivity for paddy (1.14%) and sugarcane (0.90%) crops. The north-west plains showed an increasing trend in the yield rate of paddy (1.14%) and wheat (0.85%). The plateau zone, however, showed decreasing productivity rates for paddy (-0.17%) and wheat (-0.27%) crops.\n(iv) Constraints in the Expansion of Irrigation\nIX.14 The expansion of irrigation in the State has been constrained by several factors. Some of the prominent ones include:\nInefficiency in Existing Infrastructure: Inefficiencies in canal management, such as choking of canals and inadequate maintenance, have been significant constraints.\nInadequate Investment: Limited investment in irrigation infrastructure, particularly in minor irrigation schemes, has curtailed expansion.\nTechnical and Operational Constraints: Problems related to technical and operational aspects of tubewell irrigation, such as non-functioning of state-owned deep tubewells and unviable private investments in shallow tubewells.\nGeographical and Climatic Factors: Certain geographical areas, particularly the plateau regions, have inherent limitations that affect irrigation.\nIX.15 Addressing these constraints requires a comprehensive approach including improved infrastructure maintenance, increased investment in irrigation, and adopting better technological solutions for water management. Efforts to enhance the efficiency of existing irrigation networks, along with expanding the coverage of minor irrigation schemes, are essential for achieving optimal irrigation levels and improving agricultural productivity in the State.\n\nIX. Irrigation and Crop Production in Bihar\nIX.21 Crop Intensity and Irrigation\nRelatively low levels of agricultural output in Bihar are attributed, among other factors, to low crop intensity. Crop intensity is largely influenced by the irrigation network. Given the inelastic supply of land, the objective of output maximization could be achieved either by increased use of land-augmenting inputs and/or by utilizing the same piece of land for a greater number of times, subject to resource and technology constraints. Therefore, one might expect that expanding irrigation could increase crop intensity in the state.\nRelating net and gross irrigated areas with crop intensity at both the state and district levels, using a log-linear function on data from 1976-77 to 1990-91, the elasticity of crop intensity with respect to net irrigated area was observed to be 0.10 with R2R^2R2 at 0.49. The elasticity of crop intensity with gross irrigated area for the state was observed to be 0.10 with R2R^2R2 at 0.28. Across different zones, the elasticity of crop intensity with net irrigated area was found to be significant only in the north-west and south-west plains. A similar pattern was observed across different districts, indicating a weak relationship between irrigation and crop intensity. This weak relationship might be due to the inefficient irrigation network and the low level of irrigated area.\nIX.22 Irrigation and Crop Diversification\nCreating irrigation potential involves both private and public investment. Naturally, a farmer would not only make optimal use of irrigation but also use it for crops that maximize farm income. With higher relative prices for cash crops, farmers are prompted to allocate more land to these crops while minimizing the area for food grain crops to ensure food security. With non-food grain crop areas at a minimum of around 7.0% in Bihar, there seems to be scope for further expanding cash crops. Creation of additional irrigation potential, coupled with adequate prices, may encourage the cultivation of more cash crops in the state.\nConsidering the increase in the percentage area under non-food grain crops as a proxy for crop diversification towards commercialization, and relating it to the percentage of gross irrigated area, there is a significant negative relationship between the two with elasticity at -0.44 at the state level.
