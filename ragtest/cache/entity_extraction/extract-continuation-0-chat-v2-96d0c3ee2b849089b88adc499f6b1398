The flood situation is most severe in the northern plains of Bihar. This is because almost all the major rivers in the State enter Bihar from Nepal in this region. The bed slope of these rivers is very sharp in Nepal, and they usually enter the State on plain lands. Because of a sudden drop in bed slope, silt brought by the flow of these rivers gets deposited at their base, causing recurring floods.\nWhile a long-term solution to this problem can be achieved by constructing dams at the upper catchments of Kosi, Gandak, Bagmati, and Mahananda rivers in Nepal territory, in the short run, Bihar has to depend on the construction and maintenance of embankments along the rivers. Till March 2006, 3430.47 km length of embankments have been constructed in the State, which protect 29.16 lakh hectares of area, out of a total of 68.80 lakh hectare flood-prone area. Thus, 39.64 lakh hectares of land area still stands exposed to the perennial problem of floods. Despite such high exposures to the threat of floods, only 29 percent of the total 10th Plan allocation for flood control has been utilized (Table 2.8). A more efficient utilization of the allocated funds would have lessened the damage capacity of floods in the State.\nBesides the menace of floods, about 9.41 lakh hectares of land suffer from the problem of waterlogging in Bihar. It has been found by various Expert Committees that it would not be economically viable to free 2.5 lakh hectares of land from waterlogging due to excessive depth. Thus, against 6.91 lakh hectares of waterlogged area from where water can be drained out, only about 1.50 lakh hectares have been freed from waterlogging. The task ahead is to free the remaining 5.41 lakh hectares of land area. Against a total agreed outlay of around Rs 167 crore on drainage works in the 10th Plan, there has been an actual utilization of around 74 percent (Table 2.9).\n2.5 Irrigation\nBihar is richly endowed with water resources and has a very healthy rainfall average of 1271.9 mm. The ultimate irrigation potential in the State is estimated to be around 102 lakh hectares, which is far above the total cultivated area in the State (Table 2.10). However, neither rainfall nor the distribution of the water resources is uniform across the State, causing uneven irrigation potential/coverage across the State. While Zone-2 (Table 2) receives earliest showers and highest rainfall (1450 mm) among all three agro-climatic zones in the State, Zone-3 receives an average rainfall of only 1115 mm.\nBihar has 45.67 lakh hectares of irrigated area against its total geographical area of 93.6 lakh hectares. While the created irrigation capacity of 45.67 lakh hectares means that around 49 percent of the total area is irrigated, the distribution of irrigation capacity is not even across the State. The percentage of irrigated area varies greatly across different regions/districts, from a low of 16 percent (in Jamui) to around 86 percent (in Sheikhpura). In fact, both irrigation capacity and its source vary greatly across the 3 agro-climatic Zones of the State.\nWhile Zone 1 accounts for nearly 37 percent of the total geographical area of the State, its share in total created irrigation capacity of the State is about 31 percent (Table 2.11). On the other hand, Zone 3B, which also accounts for 31 percent of the geographical area, has about 41 percent of total irrigated land in the State. Zone 3A, having 13 percent of the geographical area of the State, has only around 8 percent of the total irrigated area. Finally, while around 64 percent of Zone 3B area is irrigated, Zone 3A has only around 32 percent of its area irrigated.\nThis variation in irrigation capacity across the regions also extends to the sources of irrigation. Nearly 63 percent of total created irrigation capacity in the State has tubewells as its source (Table 2.12). Canal irrigation accounts for nearly 30 percent of the total irrigated area. Thus, major and medium sources of irrigation together account for 93 percent of total created irrigation capacity in the State, with other sources (minor and micro irrigation) accounting for only about 7 percent of total irrigation. A very high dependence on irrigation on tube wells, and operation of diesel tubewells due to lack of power infrastructure in the rural areas means a high cost and inefficient irrigation.\nThe variation in irrigation source has a very clear pattern across the agro-climatic zones of the State. While nearly 50 percent of irrigation in Zone 3B has canal as its source, only 13 percent of the irrigated area in Zone 2 receives canal irrigation. Reliance on tubewells is very high in Zones 1 and 2 (source of 85 percent of Zone 1’s irrigated area). On the other hand, canals have a greater role to play in Zones 3A and 3B, and there is a greater balance between tubewell and canal irrigation in these regions. Incidentally, the latter two zones are also the zones with the lowest rainfall among all the regions of the State. Thus, while the importance of canal irrigation is much greater in the southern parts of Bihar (Zone 3), there is an almost exclusive reliance on tubewell irrigation in the northern parts, especially in Zone 2\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India facing severe flood problems and issues of waterlogging, with a significant portion of its land still exposed to floods despite efforts to construct embankments.
