Goats, in particular, are an important source of additional income for small and marginal farmers and play an important role in poverty alleviation.\nLivestock Sales\nMilk and animal sales are the two major constituents of sale from livestock in Bihar. Together, they account for: 90 Percent of Livestock-Related Monthly Receipts\n\nENSURE YEAR-ROUND ACCESS\nTO NUTRITIOUS FOODS IN MUNGER, BIHAR\nIn Bihar’s Munger district, the TARINA program is promoting homestead horticulture as a strategy to ensure that farmers have increased access to and availability of diverse foods throughout the year. Using community platforms like self-help groups, farmer field schools (FFSs), and other interest groups, TARINA designed a unique combination of technical inputs, which includes:\nGenerating an understanding and awareness of the role kitchen gardens can play in ensuring nutritious diets;\nDeveloping a package of practices focused on land preparation, sowing methods, and pest management;\nArranging for a subsidized provision of quality seeds in a timely manner through the National Horticulture Research and Development Foundation (NHRDF) and private agencies.\nAs a result, the proportion of households with kitchen gardens in Munger increased from 20 percent in 2016–17 to 44 percent in 2018–19. Furthermore, production diversity in homestead gardens has increased from 3–4 types of vegetables to up to 13 (including green leafy vegetables). This intervention directly relates to SDG2.1 (ensuring access to nutritious foods throughout the year).\nAssociated market linkages are also being supported by the government through the Rural Backyard Poultry Scheme 2014–15. On a larger scale, the Integrated Poultry Development Scheme is promoting the construction of broiler poultry farms, aimed at enhancing employment and meat production. Bihar has witnessed an increase in the production of milk, eggs, wool, meat, and fish for the period 2014–19.\n\nPromoting Small Ruminants in Munger, Bihar\nPromoting small ruminants such as goats and poultry, dairy production through improved animal health services, and advanced livestock management are strategies employed by the TARINA program in Munger. The objective of this intervention is to strengthen the income pathway for improved nutritional outcomes. As a result of the intervention, there has been an increase in the share of households that own livestock from 63 percent to 77 percent. This increase has resulted from a multi-pronged program that identified and responded to existing constraints and challenges in a comprehensive manner.\nIntervention Details\nPillars of the Intervention\nImproved breeding, feeding systems, preventive health care, and better market linkages are the pillars on which the intervention with small ruminants is designed. These are mediated through buck user groups and women farmers’ collectives.\nAchievements\nOver the last four years, TARINA has focused on improving animal health and services management in Munger by way of vaccination and deworming camps for farmers with goats, as well as training on feed management.\nFigure 5.37 shows that in Bihar, farmers were able to increase their income from livestock from Rs. 1,847 per household to Rs. 2,642 per household. This intervention relates to SDG 2.3 of increasing incomes.\nLivestock Production Statistics\nEgg Production\nEgg production increased from 6 million tons in 2011–12 to nearly 10 million tons in 2018–19, with an annual growth rate of 14.6 percent between 2014 and 2019.\nMeat Production\nMeat production registered a modest increase from nearly 3 lakh tons in 2014 to 3.6 lakh tons in 2019. Fish production also saw growth from 4.8 lakh tons in 2014–15 to 6 lakh tons in 2018–19, with an annual growth rate of 6 percent.\nDairy Production\nThe per capita availability of milk has increased from 147 grams in 2004–05 to 228 grams in 2016–17, though this is still lower than the national average and just above the minimum daily intake recommended by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).\nChallenges and Opportunities\nYield Improvement\nDespite increases in livestock numbers, there is room for improvement in yield for milk, eggs, and meat. For instance, Bihar’s milk production rate is among the lowest in the country at 3.7 kg/day/milking animal.\nMarket and Credit Access\nAn increase in market density through new markets and strengthened institutional arrangements related to procurement is required. Additionally, access to credit is crucial for smallholder farmers to invest in inputs or infrastructure. In rural Bihar, the credit-to-deposit (CD) ratio was low at 34 percent in 2018–19 compared to the national average of 78.2 percent. Small finance banks and Kisan credit cards (KCCs) are important for increasing financial inclusion.\nRecommendations\nIrrigation and Crop Management\nAssured access to timely irrigation is essential for productivity. Investments in irrigation infrastructure and crop management practices are recommended to increase yield potential.\nDiversification and Market Systems\nDiversification of the cropping system and improved market access are important for income gains. Enhancing market density, promoting FPOs, and expanding road infrastructure are crucial.\nWomen’s Role and Nutritional Outcomes\nWomen can influence the crop mix for both household consumption and market sale. Ensuring that women are included in agricultural transformations aligns with SDG 2.3.\nFood Safety-Net Programs\nImprovements in yields and diversification can increase the supply of micronutrient-rich foods in Bihar’s\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India where livestock ownership contributes significantly to household incomes and where the TARINA program is promoting agricultural and nutritional improvements)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TARINA PROGRAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A program designed to ensure year-round access to nutritious foods in Munger, Bihar, through homestead horticulture and promoting small ruminants among other strategies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUNGER<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar where the TARINA program is active, focusing on agricultural and nutritional improvements)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL HORTICULTURE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOUNDATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An organization involved in providing quality seeds in a timely manner for the TARINA program in Munger, Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RURAL BACKYARD POULTRY SCHEME 2014–15<|>EVENT<|>A government-supported scheme aimed at enhancing employment and meat production through the construction of broiler poultry farms in Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTEGRATED POULTRY DEVELOPMENT SCHEME<|>EVENT<|>A scheme promoting the construction of broiler poultry farms to enhance employment and meat production in Bihar)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TARINA PROGRAM<|>MUNGER<|>The TARINA program is specifically designed to operate within Munger, Bihar, focusing on nutritional and agricultural improvements<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TARINA PROGRAM<|>NATIONAL HORTICULTURE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOUNDATION<|>The TARINA program collaborates with the National Horticulture Research and Development Foundation to provide quality seeds in Munger<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>RURAL BACKYARD POULTRY SCHEME 2014–15<|>The Rural Backyard Poultry Scheme 2014–15 is a government initiative to support poultry farming in Bihar<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>INTEGRATED POULTRY DEVELOPMENT SCHEME<|>The Integrated Poultry Development Scheme aims to enhance poultry farming in Bihar<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
