More specifically, women’s ability to influence production decisions and membership in self-help groups correlate with improved dietary diversity.\n\nWomen’s Economic and Social Security\nEconomic and social security for women is integrated into several state government schemes, including:\nLakshmibai Social Security Pension Scheme\nMukhyamantri Kanya Vivah Yojana\nMukhyamantri Nari Shakti Yojana\nThe Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA) ensures women's participation by mandating that one-third of total person-days of work created be allocated to women. In Bihar, women's share of MNREGA employment stood at 52 percent in 2018–19.\nWhile women make up the majority of agricultural workers in Bihar, their ownership of agricultural land remains extremely low. Land is a crucial asset that influences both agricultural production and income. In the state, less than 13 percent of women own agricultural land, and their landholdings are predominantly marginal and smaller than male-owned landholdings. This disparity affects their ability to diversify production and enhance productivity.\nBarriers to Land Ownership\nIndian women face numerous barriers to land ownership, including:\nLack of Awareness: Many women are unaware of their inheritance rights.\nReluctance to Claim Property: Women may hesitate to claim property from hostile family members.\nSkewed Implementation of Laws: Gendered social discrimination persists due to uneven law enforcement.\nOne major issue is the mediation of women’s land rights in India through various personal laws and customary practices, rather than through legal procedures.\nWage Gap and Economic Impact\nDifferences in women’s participation in agriculture and land ownership are reflected in a wage gap. Women’s incomes are crucial not only for overall household income but also for influencing decisions related to nutritional outcomes, such as food purchases and spending on nutritious non-staples. Women’s wage rates lag behind men’s, with women in Bihar earning, on average, 80 percent of the corresponding wages earned by men.\nAccess to Credit and Financial Inclusion\nAccess to credit and decision-making regarding its use are vital for women in agriculture. Financial inclusion helps women access loans, credit, and safe savings options, which can alleviate poverty. Research indicates that closing the gender gap in financial inclusion can:\nSmooth Consumption\nLower Financial Risks and Costs\nProvide Security\nIncrease Savings and Investment Rates\nFacilitate New Business Opportunities\nProgress has been made in financial inclusion at both state and national levels. As of March 2018, Bihar had over three crore female bank accounts with a consolidated amount exceeding 60,000 crores. Women’s self-help groups, such as JEEViKA, have been instrumental in improving women’s socioeconomic empowerment and financial literacy through digital financial inclusion efforts.\nEducation\nPoor nutritional outcomes often result from a diet lacking essential nutrients, with women playing a central role in household food decisions. Education is crucial for raising awareness about nutritious diets. Rural literacy rates in Bihar are below the national average, with fewer women being literate compared to men.\nTCI–TARINA Research on Women’s Self-Help Groups\nWomen’s group membership has potential benefits, providing access to various resources and information. TCI–TARINA has been working to strengthen women's self-help groups in Munger, Bihar, using these groups to:\nPromote Behavior Change Communication (BCC)\nIncrease Awareness on Homestead Gardens\nIntroduce Technologies for Reducing Drudgery and Postharvest Losses\nThe groups are also supported through:\nTrainings\nInterface Meetings with Market Value Chain Actors\nExposure Visits for Cross-Learning\nExposure visits and meetings have helped self-help group leaders understand federation management and the benefits of collective marketing. TARINA’s training has developed leadership skills among group members, leading to a 15 percent increase in self-help group membership in Munger over two years.\n6.3 Recommendations\nWomen’s Empowerment in Agriculture\nWomen’s empowerment, specifically in agriculture, needs to be promoted not just as an end in itself but as a means for achieving improved nutritional outcomes. Ensuring women’s access to productive resources and enabling them to have greater input in decisions related to production, use of income, and time use are areas for targeted intervention. Since most women are engaged in agriculture, they need access to and ownership of inputs of production, like land, irrigation, seeds, and credit, as well as access to the information needed to effectively use them. To achieve this, public extension systems need to be strengthened to specifically address the challenges and constraints faced by women farmers.\nAccess to Gender-Specific Technologies\nAccess to gender-specific technologies can also have implications for nutritional outcomes. Agricultural activities at different points of time in the crop cycle can take up a lot of women’s time. This not only influences their own nutrition but also affects the time they have available for childcare and food preparation. In this respect, technologies aimed at reducing women’s drudgery should be promoted. Efforts to do so should consider the specific nature of the work done by women and address the challenges and constraints that they may face in adopting the technology.\nIncreasing Demand for Micronutrient-Rich Foods\nFocusing on women’s empowerment is a strong channel for ensuring that there is an increased demand for, and purchase of, micronutrient-rich foods for household consumption. Women’s participation in the labor and produce markets will determine their wages and/or income from the sale of produce. For this, women need to be linked to markets by way of information, infrastructure, and institutional arrangements, like self-help groups or FPOs, that result in better price realization through collective bargaining power.\nJEEViKA’s Livelihood Programs\nJEE\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TARINA BASELINE SURVEY<|>EVENT<|>A survey conducted in 2017 focusing on the relationship between women's empowerment in agriculture and dietary diversity in households)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAKSHMIBAI SOCIAL SECURITY PENSION SCHEME<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A state government scheme aimed at providing economic and social security to women)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUKHYAMANTRI KANYA VIVAH YOJANA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A state government scheme aimed at supporting the marriage of daughters from financially weaker sections)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUKHYAMANTRI NARI SHAKTI YOJANA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A state government scheme aimed at empowering women)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHATMA GANDHI NATIONAL RURAL EMPLOYMENT GUARANTEE ACT (MNREGA)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A government initiative ensuring women's participation in the workforce by mandating a third of the workdays to women, with a significant participation in Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India where women make up the majority of agricultural workers but have low ownership of agricultural land)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JEEVIKA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A women's self-help group instrumental in socioeconomic empowerment and financial literacy in Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TCI-TARINA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An organization working to strengthen women's self-help groups in Munger, Bihar, through various initiatives)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUNGER<|>GEO<|>A location in Bihar where TCI-TARINA is actively working to empower women's self-help groups)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAKSHMIBAI SOCIAL SECURITY PENSION SCHEME<|>BIHAR<|>A scheme integrated into Bihar's state government initiatives for women's economic and social security<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MUKHYAMANTRI KANYA VIVAH YOJANA<|>BIHAR<|>A scheme integrated into Bihar's state government initiatives for women's economic and social security<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MUKHYAMANTRI NARI SHAKTI YOJANA<|>BIHAR<|>A scheme integrated into Bihar's state government initiatives for women's economic and social security<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAHATMA GANDHI NATIONAL RURAL EMPLOYMENT GUARANTEE ACT (MNREGA)<|>BIHAR<|>Ensures women's participation in the workforce in Bihar<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JEEVIKA<|>BIHAR<|>Improves women's socioeconomic empowerment and financial literacy in Bihar<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TCI-TARINA<|>MUNGER<|>Works to strengthen women's self-help groups in Munger, Bihar<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
