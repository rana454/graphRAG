Women’s participation in the labor and produce markets will determine their wages and/or income from the sale of produce. For this, women need to be linked to markets by way of information, infrastructure, and institutional arrangements, like self-help groups or FPOs, that result in better price realization through collective bargaining power.\nJEEViKA’s Livelihood Programs\nJEEViKA’s livelihood programs have benefited women immensely by ensuring that incomes reach their hands. Empowered women with cash in hand can access nutrition-rich food for their families. If market signals are correct, JEEViKA programs can encourage women to take up the farming of nutrition-rich crops. JEEViKA’s kitchen garden program can be further improved to ensure a year-round supply of micronutrient-rich vegetables for the families. The JEEViKA program can help increase incomes by plugging into poultry and dairy value chains. As productivity and production of nutrient-rich vegetables and animal-sourced foods increase, they will be more accessible to the poor.\nSupport for Women in Fisheries and Small Ruminants\nWomen play an important role in managing fisheries and small ruminants in Bihar. Technology and market support to such women can contribute to their incomes immensely, which can then be directed toward higher demand for nutrition-rich food. The Department of Rural Development can use its MGNREGA program to help the landless and women get work on projects that could transform soil and water conservation across the state, especially the drier regions of southern Bihar.\nNutrition Awareness and Behavior Change Communication (BCC)\nAs discussed in this chapter, women play a crucial role in influencing not just the quantity and quality of food available but also its preparation and distribution among members of the household. Nutrition awareness and behavior change communication (BCC) campaigns need to explicitly focus on what makes a diet nutritious and why it is important, with an emphasis on seasonal foods that can be locally sourced, in addition to the needs of vulnerable groups like infants and pregnant and lactating mothers. Additional areas where BCC can focus are food safety and zoonotic diseases. Such BCC should leverage existing platforms like the JEEViKA self-help groups, together with schools and Anganwadi centers, to target women and children. These can be supported by experts from the Departments of Health and Education, as well as development organizations like CARE India and Project Concern International. Such collaborations can help tailor the BCC for different age groups, such as the Infant and Young Child Feeding program (IYCF) for infants.\n7 Health Environment: Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene\nWater, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) make up the environmental health pathway for improved nutritional outcomes. Although agriculture directly and indirectly influences food availability, and women’s empowerment determines the intrahousehold allocation of that food, it is WASH-related factors that determine the eventual absorption of nutrients from dietary intake, and thereby, influence individual-level nutrient status. The absorption of essential nutrients can be adversely affected if individuals do not have adequate access to clean drinking water and sanitation facilities.\nPoor health environments result in illnesses like diarrhea, which is the leading cause of child mortality in children under 5 in developing countries. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), diarrhea caused by unsafe water and a lack of basic sanitation and hygiene claims the lives of more than 1.5 million children of less than 5 years of age every year. Approximately 700 million people still practice open defecation throughout the world, mostly in South Asia. According to NITI Aayog’s 2019 report, WASH factors are responsible for half of India’s undernutrition burden. The SDG agenda reflects the importance of WASH in the interactions between various SDGs. SDG6 focuses on ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. Such an endeavor calls for expanding international cooperation and garnering the support of local communities in improving water and sanitation management.\nIn Bihar, two of the seven areas identified in the state government’s “Saat Nishchay” program relate to WASH—Har Ghar Nal Ka Jal (every household should have running tap water) and Shauchalaya Nirman Ghar Ka Sammaan (construction of toilets enhances the prestige of the home).\nReferences:\nPingali and Ricketts (2014)\nUN (2019b)\nNITI Aayog (2019b)\n7.1 Water: Access and Quality\nGlobally, there are close to 800 million people without access to drinking water. In Bihar, 64 percent of rural households had access to drinking water in 2017–18 (Figure 7.1). At the district level, the share of households with water within their premises ranges from 77 percent in Rohtas to 18 percent in Jamui (Figure 7.2).\nHouseholds access drinking water from different types of sources, like hand pumps, public taps or standpipes, and taps within their own homes. When such varied sources of water are considered “improved drinking water sources,” then we find that nearly all the households in the country, including Bihar, have access to water from an improved drinking water source.\nHowever, hand pumps are the source for 95 percent of rural households, while piped water reaches less than 10 percent of rural households in the state. Based on the data published in the NITI Aayog’s SDG Annual Report 2020, sourced from the Ministry of Jal Shakti, the percentage of the rural population in Bihar receiving safe and adequate drinking water within their premises through piped water supply stood at just 5.76 percent in 2017 and increased to 7 percent in 2019.
