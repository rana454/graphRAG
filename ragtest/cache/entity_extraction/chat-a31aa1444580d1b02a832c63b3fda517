Strategy of minimizing grant support to producers and BDS providers. Benefits continue post-project.\nProject Outputs: Significant increase in productivity from 30kg to over 40kg per hive, even in a year of moderate productivity, and a substantial increase in the number of producers from around 1,800 to over 9,000.\nLinkages: Both upstream and downstream linkages have been significantly enhanced. These include increased numbers of bee box suppliers, foundation sheet makers, brood suppliers, and a better flow of credit to producers, on the one hand, and increased activity of market agents as honey buyers, on the other.\nMarketing: Competition between buyers of corporate branded honey marketers as well as individual market agents (and the advent of a large marketing cooperative) has greatly enhanced choice for producers/sellers with the selling price of the product increasing from Rs 30-35 in 2002 to Rs 55-65 in 2008.\nProducer Institutions: The organization of as many as 45 producer associations in Bihar represents a significant step forward for the VC project. The variable quality of these associations and the weakness of the beekeepers’ federation is the result of the fragmented and feudal nature of society in the region.\nContribution to Poverty Reduction: Sample estimates – 80% beekeeper households report an increase in income; 40% below ‘$1/day’ in 2002, reduced to 30% in 2008. (Non-beekeeper samples show a small increase in poverty from 38% to 44%). One-third hire one full-time employee for beekeeping. Another 7% hire seasonal labor. Wages at par with, or slightly above, local market conditions.\nCost-Effectiveness: A five-fold growth in producer numbers and a 12-fold increase in production, together with a 2.5 times increase in the price of honey, results in a very low project cost ($129) per beekeeper and a very high\n \nHoney Value Chain Project in Muzaffarpur, Bihar\nContext:\nLocation: Muzaffarpur district, Bihar, India.\nPopulation: Over 90 million, with 88% in rural areas.\nDevelopment Indicators: Bihar has low per capita income, high poverty rates, and low literacy rates compared to national averages.\nChallenges Identified in 2000:\nLack of scientific knowledge in beekeeping.\nDispersed beekeeping operations.\nIneffective support from institutions and government agencies.\nLack of access to finance.\nMinimal local value addition.\nKey Interventions (2002-2008):\nTraining:\nProvided training in basic beekeeping, disease control, and honey extraction.\nPublished a guidebook in Hindi.\nFinance:\nLinked beekeepers to banks for credit.\nSupported associations in securing financial resources.\nFormation and Capacity Building:\nFormed beekeepers’ associations and a state-level federation.\nTrained beekeepers in entrepreneurial skills and cooperative management.\nMarket Development:\nDeveloped partnerships with local and national buyers (e.g., Timul).\nPromoted local marketing agents (PMAs).\nLaunched a website for market visibility.\nRelated Activities:\nEstablished honey processing plants and testing facilities.\nFacilitated the creation of beekeeping-related businesses.\nAdvocacy:\nLobbied to reduce sales tax on honey.\nAddressed issues with police and forest department harassment.\nHoney Value Chain Actors:\nUpstream:\nBeekeepers (mainly from the Kushwaha community).\nBeekeepers’ associations and federation.\nMid and Downstream:\nCorporate buyers (e.g., Dabur India Ltd, Timul).\nLocal honey processors and marketing agents.\nService Providers:\nSuppliers of beekeeping inputs (e.g., hive makers, bee colony suppliers).\nBanks and informal moneylenders.\nPromotional Institutions:\nKhadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC).\nNational Horticulture Board (NHB).\nRajendra Agriculture University (RAU).\nOutputs and Impacts:\nProduction: Increased from ~1,800 beekeepers with 28 hives each in 2002 to 9,000 beekeepers with 44 hives each in 2008. Honey extraction increased to 45 kg per hive per year.\nTrained Beekeepers: Nearly 4,000 beekeepers trained, improving honey quality.\nProducers’ Organizations: Formation of 45 associations and a federation with 19 associations.\nTrading: Increased market choices and bargaining power. Local traders and PMAs developed, improving honey prices.\nConsumer Marketing: Timul entered the market, influencing prices positively.\nPricing: Significant increase in honey prices, with raw litchi honey reaching Rs55-60 per kg.\nExternal Factors:\nPolitical/Legal: Beekeeping recognized but faced challenges such as sales tax and harassment by officials. Efforts were made to address these issues.\nMarket: Growing international demand for honey, with India exporting significant quantities. Domestic market for litchi honey is strong due to its premium quality.\nAssessment of Changes (2002-2008):\nHousehold Surveys: Indicate improvements in beekeeping practices, incomes, and asset building.\nFocus Groups: Confirmed enhanced resilience and economic benefits for beekeepers.\nConclusion: The honey value chain project in Muzaffarpur significantly improved the local beekeeping industry, increased production and income, and strengthened market linkages. Despite challenges, the project has made a substantial impact on beekeepers’ livelihoods and the regional honey market.\n\nTable 2: Pilot Sample\nRespondents Number\nHousehold Questionnaires:\nVC-participating beekeeping households: 40\nWage workers employed in beekeeping enterprises: 4\nComparison households – non-beekeepers: 10\nKey Informant Interviews:\nInput providers (wooden beehive makers): 2\nProfessional marketing agent: 1\nMilk Marketing Coop.
