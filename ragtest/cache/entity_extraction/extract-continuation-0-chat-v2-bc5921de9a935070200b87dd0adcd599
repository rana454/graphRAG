To make matters worse, credit and marketing are weak, while connectivity, storage, and processing infrastructure are poor. Additional investments are required in all areas, including increasing the share of consumption of electricity for agricultural purposes that can kick-start the process of agricultural transformation in the state. There is a need for investment in the management of floods in north Bihar and in watershed and drought resilience programs in south Bihar. Increasing investments in surface- and groundwater-based irrigation systems and introducing small-scale group irrigation systems, like shallow dug wells, can help improve cropping intensity and productivity. Focused investments for enhancing productivity in dairy, fisheries, poultry (for both meat and eggs), and small ruminants could target marginal and landless communities. Continuing to provide support to FPOs would help aggregate the farm surplus for marketing purposes. In the absence of agricultural produce market committees (APMCs), Bihar must ensure that markets work for its farmers and the poor in general. The increased incomes, realized as a result of improved access to markets, can help transform nutritional outcomes by increasing smallholder farming communities’ demand for, and access to, more diverse, nutritious foods.\nPromote Nutrition-Sensitive Policies for Enhancing the Supply of Nutrient-Rich Food\nThe broad objectives of Bihar’s food policy should be focused on nutrition security, that is, ensuring that households are able to access and afford diverse, nutritious foods throughout the year. This contrasts with the current focus on calorie sufficiency, a legacy of Green Revolution-era policies that promoted the production and consumption of staples, like rice and wheat, to alleviate hunger. Those policies now need to be reoriented toward the goal of nutrition security, given the persistent problem of undernutrition, together with the emergence of overnutrition, as reflected in obesity and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Such a reorientation will result in a diversification of production activities toward nutrient-dense non-staples, like coarse cereals and pulses; protein-rich, animal-sourced foods; and micronutrient-rich foods, like fruits and vegetables; thereby ensuring an increase in the supply of such foods. To achieve this, Bihar’s predominantly smallholder farming community will need access to irrigation, quality seeds, technology, extension services, and well-functioning markets. Promoting Makhana and fishery-based farming systems in north Bihar would diversify cropping systems, apart from making more fish available for consumption. Promoting pulses in the rice–fallow regions in high residual moisture zones, with improved technologies, would enhance pulses production while also improving soil health. Bihar has immense potential for enhancing fruit and vegetable production through the adoption of high-quality seeds and an improved package of practices. With Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) situated in every district of Bihar, technology dissemination for last-mile outreach should be given a boost. The private sector must be encouraged to ensure supplies of seeds appropriate to field conditions in the state.\nMake Food Safety Nets Nutritionally Diverse\nThe three main food safety nets—the MDM, ICDS, and PDS—can be used as channels to make diverse, nutrient-rich nonstaples affordable and accessible to the poor by adding millets and pulses in the PDS supplies and increasing the proportion of vegetables and pulses in the ICDS and MDM programs. Bihar should consider providing milk, eggs, and fish through its MDM and ICDS programs to improve the nutritional outcomes of children and women, while boosting growth for these sectors in the state. Bihar could aim to replicate what Odisha is trying by providing fish in food safety-net programs that target children. Supplies to food safety-net programs could also include provisioning for fortified foods like fortified milk and biofortified foods, like high-zinc wheat and rice. HarvestPlus has been promoting high-iron pulses in Bihar, which could be introduced in the MDM and Anganwadis across the state. Bihar has also been piloting nutrition gardens in government schools in rural areas, and that effort can be scaled up and spread throughout the state. Efforts should be made to provide maximum coverage to all vulnerable segments of the population in all the food safety-net programs, including the migrants who have returned home after the COVID-19 crisis and to their families.\nInvest in Women’s Empowerment for Improved Health Outcomes\nWomen play an important role both as nutrition gatekeepers for their families and as participants in agricultural activities and decision-making. Research has shown that women who are empowered in agriculture are less likely to have micronutrient deficiencies and more likely to consume a diverse diet. Therefore, women need to be supported by ensuring their access to resources and input in decisions related to agricultural activities. At the same time, women also benefit from both awareness campaigns that highlight the importance of nutrition and support for nutrition-sensitive diversification activities, like kitchen gardens and backyard poultry raising. Fortunately, the JEEViKA program in Bihar has been focusing on social and behavior change communication interventions among women across the state. Change has been visible on the ground, but efforts must be increased to ensure that the empowered women act as agents of social change.\nInvest in WASH to Aid Nutrient Absorption\nTo improve nutrient outcomes, there needs to be a recognition of the health environment’s impact on nutrient absorption. Efforts to increase the supply of, and demand for nutritious foods will be reflected in improved nutritional outcomes when conditions related to WASH are sufficiently in place. There must be investment in BCC programs related to open defecation and ensuring the supply of contaminant-free, piped drinking water. WASH interventions are especially important in the flood-prone areas of north Bihar, where every year communities suffer due to the breakdown of water and sanitation infrastructure and the spread of waterborne diseases like cholera. Bihar must also ensure safe drinking water that is free of harmful microbes and excess arsenic\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India focusing on agricultural transformation, nutrition security, and women's empowerment through various programs and investments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JEEVIKA PROGRAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A program in Bihar focusing on social and behavior change communication interventions among women to empower them and act as agents of social change)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MDM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mid-Day Meal program aimed at improving nutritional outcomes of children by providing milk, eggs, and fish in Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ICDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Integrated Child Development Services program that aims to make diverse, nutrient-rich nonstaples affordable and accessible to the poor in Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Public Distribution System that can be used to make millets and pulses available to the poor in Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARVESTPLUS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An organization promoting high-iron pulses in Bihar to be introduced in the MDM and Anganwadis across the state)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KRISHI VIGYAN KENDRAS (KVKs)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Centers situated in every district of Bihar for technology dissemination to boost agricultural productivity)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>JEEVIKA PROGRAM<|>The JEEViKA program is implemented in Bihar to empower women and improve health outcomes<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>MDM<|>Bihar aims to improve nutritional outcomes through the MDM program by providing milk, eggs, and fish<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>ICDS<|>Bihar utilizes the ICDS program to make diverse, nutrient-rich foods accessible to the poor<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>PDS<|>Bihar considers adding millets and pulses in the PDS supplies to improve nutrition<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>HARVESTPLUS<|>HarvestPlus collaborates with Bihar to promote high-iron pulses for nutritional programs<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>KRISHI VIGYAN KENDRAS (KVKs)<|>KVKs are crucial for technology dissemination in Bihar's agricultural sector<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
