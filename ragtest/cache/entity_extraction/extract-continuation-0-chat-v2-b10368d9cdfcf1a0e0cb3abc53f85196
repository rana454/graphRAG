SDG2 explicitly focuses on both the importance of ending all forms of malnutrition and the role that agriculture can play in achieving that goal. These factors are crucial for Bihar, which has one of the highest rates of malnutrition in the country—especially among women and children—and is a largely rural population. Nearly half of children under the age of five in the state are stunted and underweight. It also ranks among the top five states in the country with the highest proportion of women and children with anemia. Most of the burden of malnutrition is concentrated in rural Bihar, where the population is heavily dependent on agriculture as a source of livelihood. Bihar’s Economic Survey 2019–20 recognizes that agriculture is the mainstay of the state’s economics, influencing food security and overall rural development. The sector accounts for one-fifth of the gross state value-added. Even though the share of agriculture in gross state domestic product (GSDP) has declined from 36 percent in 2000–01 to 20 percent in 2017–18, the sector continues to be an important source of employment for more than 70 percent of the population.\nFood Systems Approach\nThe food systems approach for achieving zero hunger in Bihar is based on investments in agriculture, leading to better household-level nutrition via higher incomes, access to diverse foods, more equitable intrahousehold food allocation, and improved health environments. Agriculture in Bihar is characterized by small and marginal holdings that are exceedingly dependent on monsoons for irrigation. Together, these two characteristics have resulted in low productivity, inadequate price realization, and increasing postharvest losses. Improvements in agricultural productivity can help achieve gains in nutrition through improved access to diverse, nutritious foods, like pulses, fruits, vegetables, and livestock products, which are more nutrient-dense compared to staple grains like rice and wheat. At the same time, improved agricultural yields can also result in an increase in incomes for farmers. The increased income can result in an increased demand for, and access to, a more micronutrient-rich basket of foods that can be supplied by well-functioning local markets. However, household availability and access to food will not necessarily ensure adequate consumption. This report also considers the importance of women’s empowerment and the health environment for better health outcomes. At the individual level, women’s empowerment, particularly in agriculture, can ensure an equitable distribution of nutritious foods within the household, resulting in improved dietary diversity. Individual-level nutrition outcomes will also depend on the surrounding health and hygiene environment that influences the absorption of nutrients in the body. An overarching theme in this report is the need for convergence in the design and implementation of policies across sectors and stakeholders to achieve SDG2 in Bihar.\nKey Findings\nBihar's Malnutrition Rates\nBihar has some of the highest rates of malnutrition in the country and has made the slowest progress toward SDG2. Despite impressive gains in per capita gross domestic product (GDP) in the last decade, poverty is widespread in Bihar, and more so in the northern districts, as compared to the south. This is reflected in poor diets and nutritional outcomes for women and children. Dietary intake is primarily based on staples like rice and wheat. Protein-rich meats and eggs are consumed by less than 30 percent of children (2–4 years old) and women. Vegetables, fruits, milk, and oils account for 6 percent of calorie intake in Bihar, while the share of calories from eggs, fish, and meat is less than 1 percent. Such a lack of intake of diversified foods is reflected in poor anthropometric outcomes for children. Bihar not only has the highest prevalence of child stunting (42 percent) in the country but also poor nutritional outcomes for women, as reflected in the high rates of anemia (53 percent) and low body mass index (BMI) (35 percent). It occupies the lowest rank on the SDG India Index for 2019 and is one of the five states with the lowest indicator score for SDG2.\n\n1. Efforts to Double Farmer Incomes and Productivity\nNeed to prioritize yield stabilization and improved market linkages.\nBihar’s traditional rice–wheat cropping system is characterized by one of the lowest yields in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP). A doubling of farmer incomes in Bihar would increase the supply of and access to nutritious foods for small and marginal households in the state.\nThe stability of yields in Bihar can be ensured by investing in irrigation infrastructure, including flood and watershed management in the northern districts and the curbing of overexploitation of groundwater in the southern districts. Investments in irrigation can also help increase cropping intensity, especially in the south, by way of traditional systems like the Ahar-Pyne. Ensuring farmers have access to improved seed varieties, like shorter duration, hybrid rice and longer maturing, disease-resistant cultivars for wheat will also boost productivity. This will require investments in agricultural research and a strengthening of the seed supply chains. Policy efforts should also focus on sustained adoption of improved crop management practices, such as following an optimum date for transplantation of rice or early sowing of wheat. The adoption of technologies needs to be supported by Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) extension services and ensuring that complementary inputs are also accessible.\nIn order for income gains to be realized from yield improvements, there is a need to invest in accessible, well-functioning markets. For farmers to realize income gains, this will require strengthening farmer producer organizations (FPOs) and other aggregation models to link farmers to markets, bringing in private sector buyers following the repeal of the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act in Bihar, and further streamlining of government procurement activities.\n\n2.
