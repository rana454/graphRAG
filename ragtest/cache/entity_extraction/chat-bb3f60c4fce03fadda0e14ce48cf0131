It was, however, much less in Madhubani (134%) and East Champaran (128%).\nVII.9 Among the districts of the east alluvial plains, only Begusarai, Katihar, and Saharsa showed relatively high crop intensity at 155%, 161%, and 154% respectively. Bhagalpur and Munger, on the contrary, showed relatively low crop intensity at 122% and 123% respectively. Among the districts of the south-west alluvial plains, Rohtas alone showed crop intensity (150%) comparable to districts in the north-west and east alluvial plains. In other districts, it was modest in the range of 137% as in Patna and 144% as in Nalanda. Crop intensity among the districts of the plateau zone was dismally low in the range of 114% as in Hazaribagh and 103% as in Singhbhum.\nd) Area Sown More Than Once\nVII.10 Area sown more than once showed an increasing trend in most of the agro-climatic zones. It was increasing at 0.42% per annum in the north-west alluvial plains, 0.38% per annum in the east alluvial plains, and 1.09% per annum in the south-west alluvial plains. The plateau districts, on the contrary, showed a declining trend at (-)1.49% per annum. Amidst the general scenario of expanding area sown more than once, most of the districts in the north-west alluvial plains showed a declining trend. Such districts included Madhubani, Samastipur, Saran, Sitamarhi, Vaishali, and West Champaran. The rate of decline was as high as (-)1.90% in West Champaran and as low as (-)0.06% in Samastipur. Districts showing expansion in area sown more than once included Muzaffarpur, Gopalganj, and Siwan at 2.59%, 2.77%, and 1.50% respectively. In the east alluvial plains, only Munger and Purnea showed a declining trend at (-)5.08% and (-)0.36% respectively. In all other districts, it showed expansion in the range of 4.12% per annum as in Begusarai and 0.44% as in Bhagalpur. Districts of the south-west alluvial plains, on the contrary, showed uniformity in the expansion of area sown more than once, increasing in the range of 1.89% as in Nalanda and 1.29% as in Gaya. The scenario among the districts of the plateau zone was different with some of the districts showing a high rate of decline. The rate of decline was as high as (-)9.22% in Santhal Parganas and (-)2.03% in Dhanbad. Districts such as Singhbhum, Hazaribagh, Palamu, and Ranchi, however, showed an increasing trend in area sown more than once at 6.21%, 1.90%, and 1.61% respectively.\ne) Gross Cropped Area\nVII.12 In the context of expanding area sown more than once, gross cropped area showed shrinkage in most of the agro-climatic zones and districts. All the zones of the north-west alluvial plains, south-west alluvial plains, east alluvial plains, and plateau districts showed a declining trend in gross cropped area at (-)0.62%, (-)0.45%, (-)0.15%, and (-)2.31% respectively. The declining trend was far and wide among the districts of the north-west, in the range of (-)1.83% as in Sitamarhi and (-)0.03% as in Siwan. Amidst such a scenario, Gopalganj and Muzaffarpur showed expansion in gross cropped area at 0.51% and 1.65% respectively.\nVII.13 Shrinkage in gross cropped area was more widespread among the districts of the east alluvial plains with Munger showing a high rate of decline at (-)3.99% per annum. Bhagalpur, on the other hand, showed minimal shrinkage in gross cropped area at (-)0.09% per annum. Begusarai and Saharsa showed expansion in gross cropped area at 3.50% and 0.49% per annum respectively. Districts of the south-west alluvial plains also showed a decline in gross cropped area, although at modest rates ranging between (-)0.74% as in Aurangabad and 0.16% as in Patna. Nalanda was the lone district in this zone to show expansion in gross cropped area at 0.11% per annum. In contrast to the districts of the south-west alluvial plains, the districts of the plateau region showed a declining trend uniformly with the only exception of Dhanbad. It ranged between (-)5.53% as in Ranchi and (-)0.48% as in Hazaribagh.\nf) Crop Intensity\nVII.14 Examining the trend rates of growth in crop intensity across different agro-climatic zones, it showed an increasing trend in the north-west alluvial plains, east alluvial plains, and south-west alluvial plains at 0.28%, 0.71%, and 0.29% respectively.
