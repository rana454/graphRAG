The coefficient of variation in annual rainfall during 1980-81 to 2002-03 was 32 percent. Similarly, the prices of agricultural commodities fluctuate widely from year to year. The coefficient of variation in the farm harvest prices of paddy was as high as 45.4 percent during 1980-81 to 2002-03. In the case of wheat, it was 44.9 percent, and in maize, it was 38.9 percent. Thus, crop farming in Bihar is not only unprofitable at present but also unstable and risky. The coefficients of variation in the yields of rice, wheat, and maize were 23.4, 16.4, and 30.3 percent respectively. It has been further estimated that rainfall and market prices were the main determinants of rice output. About 71 percent of the variations in output were explained by variations in rainfall, irrigation, and farm harvest prices. Since variability in rainfall and farm harvest prices is high, the production process is quite risky. Along with low profitability, erratic rainfall and fluctuating market prices act as disincentives for farmers to invest in modernization of agriculture.\n\nWith around 90 percent of small/marginal farmers, the marketable surplus is not expected to be very high. All the same, market arrival of rice and wheat is of the order of 20-25 percent. But the quantity procured is rather negligible. This serves as one of the biggest disincentives for higher production of major commodities in the state. Since the plan envisages a much higher level of production, there is a need for improvement in the marketing system, density of markets, connectivity of the markets within the producing areas, dissemination of market intelligence, and institutional arrangement for procurement of the produce that comes to the market. The implementation of the minimum support price policy has always been poor in Bihar. Even though some surplus pockets of grains are emerging, the Food Corporation of India makes hardly any effective purchases. This has to change and the corporation has to make effective purchase arrangements.\nB. Storage & Management of Produce\nNearly one-third of our horticulture produce, especially fruits and vegetables, is wasted mainly due to poor cold storage facilities. For the same reason, the country also experiences fluctuations in the prices of horticulture produce, particularly potatoes and onions. The loss of fruits and vegetables and spices due to inadequate post-harvest handling, transportation, and storage ranged between 25 and 40 percent of the total production in Bihar.\nThe Capital Investment Subsidy Scheme (CISS) for Construction/Expansion/Modernization of Cold Storage for Horticultural Produce was introduced by the Government of India. The objective is to promote modern cold storage to avoid spoilage of perishable horticulture and other items like dairy, meat, fish, chicken, etc., provide remunerative prices to the farmers, and provide business opportunities to cold storage owners throughout the year by establishing multipurpose cold storages.\n\nThe progress of the scheme has not been very encouraging in Bihar. Considering the annual production of perishable horticulture produce at 152.50 lakh MT in the State during 2002-03, the existing post-harvest handling and cold storage capacity is inadequate. Assuming 30 percent of the marketable surplus produce to be stored, an additional cold storage capacity for approximately 14 lakh MT is required, which translates into 281 additional cold storage units of 5000 MT capacity each, and a capital investment of Rs.562 crore. At present, 27 districts out of 38 have cold storage facilities, which can take care of only about 5 percent of the total production of fruits and vegetables. Post-harvest handling facilities and cold storage units are required to be established in the remaining 10 districts. Additional facilities may be created in those districts where the number of cold storages and their capacity are inadequate. Rural godowns also have vast potential in the State in view of the fact that the majority of the farmers are small and marginal who command little holding capacity. The State Government may identify potential areas and draw up a plan for the construction of specialized storage facilities for fruits like Litchi, Mango, Banana, etc., and their processed products. This is possible only if an uninterrupted power supply to the Cold Storage units is ensured by the Bihar State Electricity Board.\nC. Agricultural Marketing\nBihar’s agricultural sector has shown impressive growth compared to other progressive states. However, income growth has not been commensurate with this trend and the challenges ahead are (i) ensuring that more value is added to production and (ii) that some of the extra value is channeled to farmers. Currently, value tends to be added outside the state, and there is a general lack of marketing mechanisms to respond to farmers’ needs. Marketing is crucial for a successful diversification and commercialization of Bihar agriculture and accelerated farmer income growth. Further income generation from Bihar’s agriculture and food sector will require addressing product quality, delivery, and pricing, despite some technical, institutional, and organizational barriers.\n\nA very small share of local production finds its way to the regulated markets in Bihar. Just as for other Indian states, Bihar has 95 regulated markets (mandis), 67 principal market yards, and 855 rural haats that handle some of the marketing of major agricultural commodities in the state. They are supervised and controlled by the State Agriculture Produce Marketing Board under the provisions of the Bihar State Agriculture Produce Marketing Act (1960). Data on market arrivals indicate that a very small share of agricultural production finds its way to the markets.
