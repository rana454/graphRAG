The average yield for fruits has remained constant at 14 tons per hectare over 2016–18, slightly below the all-India yield of 15 tons per hectare. For the same period, the growth in productivity for vegetables has been greater in the state, increasing from 17.4 tons per hectare in 2016 to 19.4 in 2018, surpassing the 18 tons per hectare average for the country as a whole.\nComparative Advantage\nWhile horticultural crops offer a diversified source of income for smallholder farmers, their share of the value of output in Bihar declined from 47.5 percent to 42 percent between 2002–03 and 2016–17. Even so, Bihar has a comparative advantage in growing fruits and vegetables. This is because the share of area under fruits and vegetables in Bihar is greater than the corresponding share in the country as a whole. Bihar also stands to benefit from the growing demand for fruits and vegetables, with the decline in per capita consumption of cereals and an increase in that of fruits, vegetables, and animal-sourced foods.\nIrrigation Methods\nOne of the factors important for horticultural crops like fruits and vegetables is improved methods of irrigation. For example, drip irrigation has been associated with less water usage and greater yields for important fruits and vegetables.\n\nIncreased Incomes and Constraints\nIncreased incomes can only be realized when binding constraints are addressed. The main constraints for the promotion of fruits and vegetables are:\nLack of Proper Marketing Arrangements\nPoor Infrastructure\nInadequate Institutional Support\nThe cost of being able to access markets is typically very high for small and marginal farmers, primarily because of:\nLow Economies of Scale\nReduced Bargaining Power\nLimited Connectivity to Markets\nInability to Obtain Information on Prices and Quality Standards in Real Time\nThe lower prices that these farmers receive often are the result of the presence of several intermediaries between the farmers and retailers. In this respect, further development and improved functioning of Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) can enable farmers to benefit from economies of scale to sell their produce at remunerative prices because of collective bargaining. In addition to facilitating access to markets for final output/produce, FPOs can also help farmers to access:\nMarkets for Credit\nInputs\nTechnology\nThe collective model also helps to reduce costs, such as those related to:\nQuality Determination\nTransportation of Produce\nFPOs can also enable better linkages to financial services.\nContract Farming and Diversification\nIn addition to FPOs, contract farming can also help promote diversification by assuring market access and incomes from agribusiness firms in the state. Contract farming is a form of vertical coordination between buyers and sellers wherein:\nThe Farmer and Retailer/Wholesaler Agree in Advance on:\nTime of Delivery\nQuantity\nQuality\nVariety of Produce\nThis arrangement reduces uncertainties. Diversification of production activities also needs to be supported by public extension activities that inform farmers about:\nNew Varieties of Crops\nMethods of Cultivation\nTechnologies\nThis is especially important for women farmers.\nPostharvest Infrastructure\nGiven the perishable and seasonal nature of produce, investments need to be geared toward ensuring adequate postharvest infrastructure along the supply chain, including:\nProcessing Centers\nCold Chains for Transport\nCold Storage Warehouses\nAs of 2019, the cold storage capacity in Bihar was 1,437,767 metric tons. In addition to promoting storage units and a cold chain for marketing, the Government of Bihar is also promoting:\nOrganic Farming\nNew Technology\nHigh-Yield Varieties\nMicro-Irrigation Methods\nUse of Quality Planting Materials\nLivestock\nOverview\nIn addition to crop diversification, another avenue for increasing incomes is diversification to include livestock systems. The livestock sector in Bihar has grown in recent years, with its share of gross state value-added increasing from:\n5.4 Percent in 2013–14 to\n5.6 Percent in 2018–19\nThe sector accounts for nearly 20 percent of total rural income. An expansion of the livestock sector stands to benefit from increasing per capita incomes in the state, accompanied by urbanization and an adequate network for transportation.\nChallenges\nPoor animal health, poor breeding, and poor reproduction each account for nearly one-third of animal losses in Bihar. Inadequate feed and nutrition account for an additional 30 percent of livestock losses (Bihar Livestock Sector Analysis, CGIAR–BMGF). Any improvements in the productivity of livestock will depend on:\nHealth and Breed Quality of the Animals\nThis is reflected in the Bihar Livestock Master Plan that, together with the agriculture roadmap, aims to promote:\nQuantity and Quality of Veterinarian and Preventive Care Services to minimize animal morbidity and mortality.\nRegular vaccination campaigns are a key component of this strategy—the number of animals immunized increased from:\n26 Lakh in 2014–15 to\n555 Lakh in 2018–19\nFurthermore, nearly 31 lakh animals were covered as part of artificial insemination programs.\nGovernment Initiatives\nThe Government of Bihar is placing an emphasis on:\nIncreasing Productivity and Production of Livestock to improve per capita incomes in the state, particularly for women and land-poor households.\nLivestock ownership contributes to household incomes, especially for households that are landless or have small or marginal landholdings. Goats, in particular, are an important source of additional income for small and marginal farmers and play an important role in poverty alleviation.\nLivestock Sales\nMilk and animal sales are the two major constituents of sale from livestock in Bihar. Together, they account for: 90 Percent of Livestock\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
