Based on the data published in the NITI Aayog’s SDG Annual Report 2020, sourced from the Ministry of Jal Shakti, the percentage of the rural population in Bihar receiving safe and adequate drinking water within their premises through piped water supply stood at just 5.76 percent in 2017 and increased to 7 percent in 2019. Thus, although Bihar has achieved universal coverage of drinking water, it is far from achieving universal coverage of piped water supply and providing quality water, which is consistent with international norms. Building on its water supply infrastructure, Bihar should aim to transition from a system that is dominated by hand pumps to a piped water system.\nSince households predominantly rely on hand pumps for drinking water, an important concern is water quality. Unlike piped water, the water from hand pumps is not treated. Boiling the water, filtering it with a cloth, or using an electric water purifier are some of the ways in which households often treat water before using it for drinking or cooking. Recent data from the NSSO indicate that 98 percent of the households reported not treating water in any of these ways before drinking it.\nBihar’s overall performance in ensuring access to clean drinking water for its rural population is poor. This is evident in its performance on NITI Aayog’s Composite Water Management Index (CWMI) for effective water management. The Index ranks states based on their performance on a comprehensive set of water indicators. The overall Index ranges from 0–100, with a higher score indicative of a better performance. In terms of rural drinking water, the Index focuses on the service delivery of water to rural areas, which accounts for 10 points in the Index. The low scores for Bihar and India, in general, are indicative of the large gaps remaining in providing the rural population with water free of arsenic and fluoride contamination. A lack of access to clean drinking water brings the risk of waterborne diseases spread by water contaminated with viral or bacterial pathogens.\nThe Government of India has initiated policies like the National Rural Drinking Water Program (NRDWP) and the Jal Jeevan Mission, which aim to guarantee safe and affordable drinking water for all. The NRDWP was initiated in 2009 to ensure that every rural household has access to at least 55 liters of water per person per day, either within their household or within a distance less than 50 m, by 2024. Since 2017, the program has also focused on addressing issues of water quality stemming from arsenic and fluoride contamination in the country and in Bihar.\n\n7.2 Sanitation and Hygiene\nOverview\nThe health environment is determined by sanitation and hygienic practices within the home and at the community level. Poor hygiene and sanitation in and around the household often result in diseases such as viral hepatitis and malaria.\nOpen Defecation\nWorldwide, and in India, one of the most significant contributors to a poor health environment is open defecation. Nearly 700 million people practiced open defecation globally in 2017. Ending the practice is explicitly mentioned in SDG6.2, as part of reducing inequalities in WASH. However, open defecation remains a widespread health and environmental hazard challenge in India. Open defecation not only reduces the quality of water for household purposes but also makes it unfit for drinking. It contributes to the conversion of large areas of land within the community into “fecal fields” that put the village, and consequently, water sources at risk of flooding with fecal material during rains. Windblown dust particles often deposited in or near water sources also potentially carry fecal pathogens. Even where water containers are used for fetching water, poor handling practices, such as placing them on the ground, could introduce fecal pathogens.\nSituation in Bihar\nAs of 2015–16, more than 70 percent of the households in every district in Bihar practiced open defecation. While the remaining households reported using a latrine, the usage differs in terms of it being improved or not and shared with another household or not. At the state level, the proportion of households with improved and non-shared sanitation facilities stood at 20 percent. The share of households with latrine facilities is less than 30 percent at the district level. Less than 10 percent of households have latrines in some districts.\nSwachh Bharat Mission\nTo address the persistent problem of open defecation, the Swachh Bharat Mission aimed to make India open defecation-free (ODF) by October 2, 2019. Based on the NITI Aayog SDG Index and Dashboard published in 2019, less than 35 percent of the districts in Bihar have been declared ODF. Several factors need to be considered when declaring a region to be ODF. These include not just the availability of latrines but also supporting infrastructure that relates to handwashing facilities, water, and soap, together with safe containment of feces and management of solid waste. Handwashing, in particular, promotes good hygiene and prevents the spread of diseases. In Bihar, while nearly 70 percent of households reportedly wash hands with soap and water after defecation, less than one-third do so before mealtimes.\nShare of Households with Latrines\nShare of ODF-verified Districts\nShare of Sanitation Facilities\nThe move toward a better health environment can be supported by BCC strategies that challenge traditional practices, inform communities about the need for change, and support them with investment in infrastructure. Women’s education and awareness can play an important role in influencing household behaviors in these areas.
