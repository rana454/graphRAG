For wheat, Mandal started producing seeds of two varieties, namely DBW-14 and Sri Ram-216, while for paddy, he took up seed production of Boro PD, Sweta Mansoori, and DB 11 varieties. He also started seed production of paddy varieties Chandan Chur and Rajendra Mansoori to fulfill his personal seed requirement. On average, Mandal produces 30 quintals each of paddy and wheat seed, taking together different varieties. He has significantly excelled in seed production with all required scientific and technical support from KVK.\nIn the initial years after Mandal started commercial seed production, he had to face problems in selling his produce. Few people in his locality were aware of his commercial venture, which was a reason behind his problem. The fact that people were not sure about the quality of the seeds produced by him also contributed to his problem.\nHowever, the problem faced by Mandal in selling seeds was resolved after people in his locality gradually came to know that he was producing seeds for commercial purposes, and they were assured about the quality of his seeds. More than 60 farmers in his area approached him for seeds last year. In fact, last year Mandal was virtually unable to meet the supply demand for seeds.\nWhile selling one quintal of wheat seed excluding input cost fetches him an amount between Rs 1500-2000, he earns between Rs 1000-1200 excluding input cost selling one quintal of paddy seed. Mandal has been registering a net income between Rs 4-5 lakh per katha from agricultural activities since he started seed production in addition to the cultivation of conventional crops. Previously, his net income was between Rs 1-1.5 lakh per katha from agricultural activities. Mandal aims to increase seed production activity in the future by taking agricultural plots on lease. By ensuring proper packaging of his produce, he intends to handle the sale of his produce more professionally from next year.\n\n2. Name: Vinita Kumar\nAge: 43 Years\nVenture: Mushroom Farming\nVillage: Parasi\nPanchayat: Muzaffarpur\nBlock: Noorsarai\nDistrict: Nalanda\nEducational Qualification: Diploma in Civil Engineering\nInstitution Facilitating Venture: KVK, Nalanda\nMUSHROOM FARMING PAVES WAY FOR SELF-EMPLOYMENT\nVinita Kumar had started mushroom farming driven by his strong urge to do something on his own for livelihood. A well-qualified man, he had previously served in the private sector for almost 15 years working in different organizations. It was in 2018 that he finally decided to quit his job and take up farming as a livelihood occupation.\nIn fact, Kumar was never satisfied serving in the private sector. His dissatisfaction also contributed to his willingness to look for self-employment opportunities. Given that Kumar belonged to an agrarian family, he always had farming in the back of his mind while looking for self-employment opportunities.\nInitially, he was slightly hesitant about taking up farming. Since Kumar’s family had only three acres of agricultural land, he was hesitant. Taking into consideration that his father and two brothers were already involved in the farming of conventional crops in the family agricultural holding, Kumar was keen on taking up agricultural activity requiring comparatively less land. This led him to consider mushroom farming. Kumar, who was able to establish himself as a successful mushroom grower, gained initial know-how about mushroom farming by watching videos on YouTube.\nSubsequently, he decided to contact scientists at Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) and Nalanda College of Horticulture (NCOH), Noorsarai for upgrading his knowledge concerning mushroom cultivation. Kumar, toying with the idea of beginning farming, tentatively decided to start mushroom cultivation before leaving his job. He had been in contact with scientists at NCOH and KVK, Nalanda since 2017. The assurance of all required support given by scientists helped Kumar make a firm decision regarding mushroom cultivation.\nThe handholding support extended to him by KVK and NCOH significantly contributed to his success as a mushroom grower. In June 2017, Kumar was enrolled by NCOH to participate in a training programme on mushroom farming. He was able to learn scientific techniques of mushroom farming\n\n5. Khagesh Mandal\nAge: 32 Years\nVenture: Strawberry Farming\nVillage: Usmanpur\nPanchayat: Usmanpur\nBlock: Kharik\nDistrict: Bhagalpur\nEducational Qualification: Matriculate\nInstitution Facilitating Venture: Bihar Agriculture University, Sabour\n\nFarmer Doubles Income Through Strawberry Farming\nA little more than two years ago, Khagesh Mandal primarily grew conventional crops and vegetables. He had hardly any idea that strawberry farming could be a viable option for diversification and increasing income.\nMandal experimented with strawberry cultivation for the first time after it was introduced in his area in 2018-19 under an Australia-India Council funded project. Implemented by Bihar Agriculture University (BAU), Sabour, the project aimed to promote strawberry cultivation as an alternative fruit. Demonstration farming of strawberry was conducted in the fields of selected farmers, with Mandal being one of three farmers in Usmanpur village who participated in this demonstration.\nThe encouraging return from the first year led Mandal to continue strawberry cultivation in the subsequent year, 2019-20. Belonging to an agrarian family, he had started farming in 2016. His family, owning only one acre of land, had leased three acres for agricultural activities. Mandal and his two brothers are engaged in farming.\nThe cultivation of conventional crops was failing to provide desired returns, prompting Mandal to start cultivating papaya and cauliflower to supplement his income. Previously, he had grown bananas extensively but discontinued banana cultivation due\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
