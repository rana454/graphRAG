The latter, in turn, can increase demand for such foods.\nWomen can also play an important role in influencing intra-household food allocation. Positive nutrition behavior campaigns that address allocation can be implemented by bringing together government departments, development sector organizations, and public and private sector companies that have a presence in Bihar. More than 900,000 women’s self-help groups have been formed across Bihar. These social capital-rich women’s institutions offer an opportunity to layer together programs related to women’s empowerment and positive nutrition behavior.\n\n5. The Role of Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene for\nNutrition security should be recognized throughout the food system, beginning with crop production and postharvest activities, to eventual nutrient absorption in the household environment.\nThe existing drinking water and sanitation programs of the national and state government need to emphasize the importance of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) for nutrition security. In addition to investments in infrastructure, like latrines and piped drinking water supplied in homes, there is a need to spread awareness of the importance of good hygiene practices, such as handwashing. The health and family welfare departments can collaborate with the JEEViKA groups in this effort. Similarly, the Department of Education can bring awareness campaigns to schools. Finally, there needs to be investment in food safety, such as using airtight bags for storing food and taking steps to address occupational risks, like disseminating information about waterborne diseases.\n\n6. Getting to Zero Hunger in Bihar Will Require\nA convergence in the policy objectives and implementation of related actions across departments and ministries, not just at national and state levels but crucially also at district and village levels.\nBihar can realize the goals of SDG2 more effectively if there is convergence between the objectives and activities of various government department policies. This begins with an explicit incorporation of nutrition security as the primary goal—not just related to reducing malnutrition (as in the POSHAN Abhiyaan, the national nutrition mission), but also related to other interlinked components of the food system like doubling productivity, empowering women, and promoting healthy environments. Such a convergence of objectives must be backed up by a convergence in implementation on the ground, meaning that these goals are jointly addressed through interlinked, coordinated activities across the departments.\n\n Introduction\nA woman walks across some farmland in Khopawer, Bihar. Related to SDG 2, there is spatial variation in the distribution of malnutrition within India. Eastern states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Odisha are characterized by low agricultural productivity, a high share of agriculture in the gross domestic product (GDP), and low levels of urbanization. Together, these factors result in low incomes and less access to diverse foods, as reflected in the high rates of undernutrition.\nThe NITI Aayog has developed the SDG India Index, which assesses the performance of each state relative to each of the SDGs. It assigns a score, ranging from 0 to 100, to each state, with the score of 100 reflecting achievement of the goal in question. The score is generated for each SDG, in addition to a composite score based on the 17 SDGs and 100 underlying indicators. The SDG score for India was 60 in 2019, up from 57 in 2018. However, at 35, the subgoal score for SDG 2 is the lowest across all SDGs. The spatial differences in the prevalence of malnutrition in India are also reflected in the state-level results. With an overall score of 50 on the SDG Index in 2019, Bihar has the lowest rank among all states. It has the highest proportion of children under 5 who are stunted. Furthermore, nearly 60 percent of pregnant women have anemia, and approximately 40 percent of children below 4 years of age are underweight. These statistics are reflected in Bihar’s performance for SDG 2, in which it scored a dismal 26, placing it ahead of only Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, and Daman and Diu. The implications for the achievement of the subgoals of SDG 2 are significant.\nPathways and National Policies\nPathways 1 and 2 are priorities in India’s national policies and are embodied in SDG 2.3, which calls for the doubling of agricultural productivity and incomes of smallholder farmers, and in SDG 2.4, which calls for resilient agricultural practices to increase productivity and production.\nAlthough the SDGs are national-level targets, there is a need for regional perspectives in analyzing progress. In this report, we discuss each of the four nutrition pathways, specifically for Bihar. In doing so, we focus on the context-specific nature of agricultural production and challenges for increasing incomes in the state, as well as the subnational status of factors like women’s empowerment that together determine the eventual nutritional status for individuals.\nThe NITI Aayog, the nodal agency for monitoring India’s progress on SDGs, recognizes that “sub-national governments hold the key to India’s quest for sustainable development.” In other words, India’s progress on the SDGs will be a function of how well it is able to progress toward realizing them in the states and Union territories. This is largely due to two reasons: first, a significant chunk of the planning, budgeting, and implementation of social, economic, and development policies related to the SDGs happens at the sub-national level; second, there are regional differences in the level of agricultural growth and structural transformation between states that can help explain why states are lagging behind the SDGs to different degrees and also indicate an optimal, context-specific policy mix to address the gap in meeting Bihar's SDG Vision report recognizes that the poor state of nutrition persists, despite impressive gains in economic growth in the\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in Eastern India characterized by low agricultural productivity, high share of agriculture in GDP, low levels of urbanization, high rates of undernutrition, and the lowest rank among all states on the SDG Index in 2019 with significant challenges in achieving SDG 2 goals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NITI AAYOG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>India's nodal agency for monitoring progress on SDGs, recognizing the importance of sub-national governments in achieving sustainable development and providing the SDG India Index scores for states)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SDG 2<|>EVENT<|>Sustainable Development Goal 2 aims to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture, with specific targets for doubling agricultural productivity and incomes of smallholder farmers, and resilient agricultural practices)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WOMEN’S SELF-HELP GROUPS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>More than 900,000 groups formed across Bihar, offering an opportunity to layer together programs related to women’s empowerment and positive nutrition behavior)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JEEVIKA GROUPS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Groups collaborating with health and family welfare departments to spread awareness of good hygiene practices as part of WASH programs for nutrition security)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Engages in awareness campaigns in schools to emphasize the importance of good hygiene practices and food safety for nutrition security)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POSHAN ABHIYAAN<|>EVENT<|>India's national nutrition mission, aiming to reduce malnutrition and interlinked with other components of the food system like empowering women and promoting healthy environments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KHOPAWER<|>GEO<|>A location in Bihar where a woman's journey across farmland is related to the challenges of malnutrition and the goals of SDG 2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>NITI AAYOG<|>NITI Aayog assesses Bihar's performance on SDGs, highlighting its challenges in achieving SDG 2 goals<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>SDG 2<|>Bihar faces significant challenges in achieving the goals of SDG 2, with the lowest rank among all states on the SDG Index for SDG 2 in 2019<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WOMEN’S SELF-HELP GROUPS<|>BIHAR<|>The self-help groups in Bihar offer an opportunity for implementing programs related to women’s empowerment and positive nutrition behavior<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JEEVIKA GROUPS<|>DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION<|>JEEViKA groups collaborate with the Department of Education to spread awareness of WASH practices for nutrition security<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POSHAN ABHIYAAN<|>BIHAR<|>POSHAN Abhiyaan, as part of its national mission, aims to address malnutrition in states like Bihar through various interlinked components<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
