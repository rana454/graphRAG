However, there is a need for developing alternative model. The proposal of the Committee headed by Shri R.C.A. Jain be accepted to upgrade marketing of produce. A suitable model of contract farming specific to crops can be adopted to solve the problems of small and marginal farmers.\n(viii) Strategic Agricultural Diversification\nTraditional crop farming alone cannot provide adequate employment and income to a growing rural population. Already the pressure of population on land is quite high. Therefore, the state should develop location specific plans for accelerated and diversified growth. Diversification could be for crop varieties as well as other produce. More areas could be brought under pulses, oilseeds, maize and diversification to horticulture, livestock, and fisheries should find greater role. Horticultural diversification should cover fruits, vegetables, mushrooms, flowers, medicinal and aromatic plants. There is a scope for coconut, oil palm, and cashew in the state. This would involve not only proper planning activities, but also the creation of necessary infrastructure, institutions, and policy support.\nFisheries and poultry, the two most important areas having a high potential, need special attention. Districts with high productivity of gram and oilseeds call for urgent action to increase the area under these crops. Government can provide support either directly or indirectly through incentives to the private sector for supply of seed/planting material, marketing, processing, etc. This is one area which is most suitable for contract farming. The contract farming is now a well-accepted institutional arrangement to realize economies of scale, promote technology adoption, and supply of needed quality inputs. The establishment of a Horticulture College at Nalanda in this respect is a welcome decision.\n(ix) Revival and Revitalisation of Sugar Mills\nSugarcane is an important cash crop for farmers in North Bihar. In addition to providing additional employment, they are an important source of surplus power. Of the 27 mills established, only a few are in operation. Most sugar mills in the state are almost sick and, therefore, the farmers do not get a fair deal from them. With proper policy support, these mills can be revitalized to provide the necessary linkages for the growth of sugarcane in the state. The state has nearly 103 thousand hectares of sugarcane area which produces about 4249 thousand tonnes of sugar cane. In recent months, the Govt. of Bihar has held several rounds of meetings with major players in sugar industry in the country for revival of sugar mills with private sector participation. But not much headway has been made, due to land policy and incentive related issues. Karnataka model can help to solve the problem where under Contract Farming, Shri Renuka Sugar Mills have entered into an agreement with the farmers as shareholders based on the land owned by them. This sector needs urgent policy attention towards the rehabilitation of existing old sugar factories and opening of new sugar factories under the PP mode. This would open new opportunities for North Bihar farmers.\n(x) Enhancing Farm Income to Make Agriculture Attractive\nSince farmers have small land holdings, the agriculture income growth is highly essential to sustain. Strategic approach is needed to enhance the farm income and to create better on-farm opportunities. Agriculture not only provides pollination support to crops and enhances the yield, but it provides additional income. Vermi-composting has proved to be highly effective in converting the waste into wealth. No one can deny the role of good quality seeds of crops, planting materials, fingerlings, and good semen. This would need special attention. Conservation of agriculture to save the resources and sustain the agriculture in the competitive world is important. Integrated farming having a combination of crops, horticulture, livestock, fisheries, apiculture, vermiculture along with multiple use of water is becoming important. Similarly, farm waste, i.e., paddy straw could be used for mushroom culture. Evidently, apiculture, vermiculture, quality seed, conservation agriculture, integrated farming, and mushroom culture have proved to be a boon and need promotion by Bihar Govt. in a Mission Mode having integration with value addition and marketing.\n(xi) Risk and Disaster Management\nGiven that more than 80% of Bihar’s population is dependent on agriculture and related activities and Bihar happens to be one of the most disaster-prone states in India, role of risk financing in hedging agricultural risk from climatic shocks becomes critical. It is imperative to develop sophisticated ways of market and government mechanisms for risk transfer. Pre-Disaster initiatives (ex ante) need to be given more impetus than Post-Disaster (ex post) Events. These initiatives aim to provide hitherto unforeseen resilience to the rural communities and also bring out transparency and efficiency to the whole effort. There should be separate risk management solutions for small and marginal farmers to hedge through futures trading and production risk management by way of index-based insurance with focus on providing Comprehensive Risk Management for vulnerable groups.\n(xii) Bihar as a Granary for India\nIf proper thrust is placed on technologies, institutional direction, farm level support services, and all delivery mechanisms, following improved farm infrastructure including rural connectivity, Bihar can definitely emerge as the ‘Granary’ for India. It can also provide the major hubs on fruits, vegetables, and fisheries for both national and global markets. The entire economic growth processes in Bihar depend on the dynamics of agriculture.\nThere are successful experiments in different parts of the country, which if adopted, can provide an answer to various problems which Bihar is facing in its race to higher productivity levels. It would be better to avail of the readily available experience with a view to adapt that in keeping with the ground situation in Bihar. If above points are addressed, there is no reason for Bihar not to be able to condense the 30 years of development activity of Punjab to 10 years. It can then surely catch\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
