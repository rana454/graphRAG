Yield per hectare was 960 kg in 1970-71, which declined until 1978-79 but started moving in an upward direction since then, reaching the peak level at 1380 kg/ha in 1991-92. The trend growth rate in arhar production was observed to be 2.87% per annum during 1971-93. Analysis of the trend rates of growth in two sub-periods suggests that while it showed an increasing trend in both sub-periods, it was marginally higher at 1.00% in the second sub-period as against 0.90% in the first sub-period. Comparing the yield level of arhar in Bihar with that of the national average and those of major states, it was found to be impressive for the State. For example, it was 640 kg/ha as the all-India average, 1110 kg/ha for Uttar Pradesh, 450 kg/ha for Maharashtra, 870 kg/ha for Madhya Pradesh, and 1260 kg/ha for Bihar in 1990-93. Moreover, while it declined annually by (-0.48%) for India as a whole, (-1.41%) in Uttar Pradesh, and (-1.37%) in Maharashtra, it increased by 1.93% annually in Bihar during 1983-93.\nIV.4.12 Regional Pattern\nAnalysis of the regional pattern in Arhar yield revealed that zones/districts with high levels of arhar production and area did not necessarily have high yields. It was relatively high in the north-west (1.32 t/ha) and the south-west (1.31 t/ha) plains. The zone of plateau districts, on the other hand, showed relatively low levels of arhar yield (0.77 t/ha). Districts showing high yield of arhar included:\nNorth-West: Siwan (1.65 t/ha), Darbhanga (1.47 t/ha), West Champaran (1.46 t/ha), and Madhubani (1.39 t/ha)\nEast: Katihar (1.42 t/ha), Purnea (1.38 t/ha), and Saharsa (1.34 t/ha)\nSouth-West: Nalanda (1.46 t/ha) and Patna (1.44 t/ha)\nPlateau Zone: Santhal Parganas (1.39 t/ha)\nIV.4.13 Trend Rates of Growth\nTrend rates of growth in the yield of arhar were impressive in all agro-climatic zones during\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
