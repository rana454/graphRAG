It, however, took an upward movement to reach 13.00 thousand tonnes in 1992-93. The trend rate of growth recorded a decline at (-)5.12% per annum during 1971-93. The rate of decline was (-)11.99% per annum in the second sub-period compared to (-)0.18% per annum in the first sub-period. The performance of the state in chilli production was poor compared to major chilli-growing states. For example, while Andhra Pradesh had a production of chilli at 320.67 thousand tonnes, it was only 7.90 thousand tonnes in Bihar in 1990-93. States like Karnataka, Maharashtra, Orissa, and Tamil Nadu were similarly much ahead of Bihar in chilli production. In terms of growth rate, it lagged far behind. In Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, and West Bengal, chilli production increased annually at 6.65%, 3.87%, and 8.92% respectively, but in Bihar, it declined annually at (-)5.31% during 1983-93.\nRegional Pattern\nAcross different zones, it was the east and the north-west plains that excelled in chilli production in the state. While the east plains had a share of 41.11% in the State chilli production, it was 34.46% for the north-west plains. Across different districts:\nBegusarai in the east plains and Rohtas in the south-west plains dominated in chilli production with shares of 32.35% and 21.84% respectively.\nOther districts that produced chilli significantly included:\nEast Champaran (2.64%)\nMuzaffarpur (2.65%)\nSamastipur (6.75%)\nVaishali (3.05%) in the north-west plains\nMuhger (1.04%) and Purnea (6.05%) in the east plains\nGaya (2.52%) and Patna (8.70%) in the south-west plains\nPalamu (2.87%) in the plateau zone\nThe declining trend in chilli production was recorded in all four agro-climatic zones. However, the zones in the north Gangetic plains, i.e., north-west alluvial plains and east alluvial plains, displayed a higher rate of decline at (-)10.35% and (-)11.33% respectively compared to those in the south of the Ganges. It was (-)5.29% for the south-west alluvial plains and (-)6.32% for the plateau regions. During the first sub-period, the rate of decline was almost uniform across different zones. It, however, became quite sharp in the second sub-period with respect to the north-west alluvial plains (-22.69%), east-alluvial plains (-25.43%), and plateau districts (-19.72%). The south-west alluvial plains maintained almost a similar rate of decline (-5.0%) even in the second sub-period. The east alluvial plains experienced a reversal from an increasing trend (0.81%) in the first sub-period to a high rate of decline (-25.43%) in the second sub-period.\nIV.10.5 Instability in Chilli Production\nDespite the general declining trend in chilli production, there were districts that showed an increase in production during 1977-91. Such districts were those with less share in state chilli production. They included:\nEast Champaran (5.13%)\nMuzaffarpur (5.01%)\nSaran (5.33%)\nWest Champaran (3.54%)\nAmong the dominant chilli-growing districts, only Vaishali (5.85%) showed an increasing trend. Samastipur and Begusarai, the other dominant chilli-growing districts, recorded a sharp declining trend during the same period.\nIV.10.6 Instability in Chilli Production\nThe rate of decline in chilli production was highly unstable with a coefficient of variation high at 31.60%. Across different agro-climatic zones, the rate of decline was relatively more stable in the south-west plains with a coefficient of variation at 24.98% compared to 35.00% in the north-west plains, 41.50% in the east plains, and 34.32% in the plateau districts. Analyzing the pattern across major chilli-growing districts, production in:\nMadhubani\nBegusarai\nPatna\nwas unstable, with the coefficient of variation exceeding 50.0% in all such cases. The increasing trend in Rohtas and Purnea also showed instability with high coefficients of variation. The declining trend rates of growth in most of the districts were found to accelerate.\nAnalysis of Acceleration/Deceleration\nThe declining trend in the growth rate of chilli production in the State showed deceleration (-1.62%). Across different zones:\nNorth-West: (-1.21%)\nEast: (-1.78%)\nPlateau Zone: (-1.16%)\nshowed deceleration, while the south-west plains showed acceleration (0.31%) in the declining trend rates of growth. Analysis at the district level suggests that in:\nPurnea: Acceleration in increasing growth rates at 0.77%\nWest Champaran: Acceleration at 0.25%\nDistricts such as Muzaffarpur, Saran, Sitamarhi, Vaishali, and Rohtas showed deceleration in their increasing growth rates. The declining trend rates of growth in most of the districts were, on the other hand, found to accelerate.\nii) Area\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
