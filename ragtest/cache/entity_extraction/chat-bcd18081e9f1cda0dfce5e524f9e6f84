For farmers to realize income gains, this will require strengthening farmer producer organizations (FPOs) and other aggregation models to link farmers to markets, bringing in private sector buyers following the repeal of the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act in Bihar, and further streamlining of government procurement activities.\n\n2. Agricultural Policy Needs to be Nutrition-Sensitive\nIn order to incentivize the diversification of the cropping system toward more nutritious nonstaple foods.\nBihar’s agricultural policies need to focus on the explicit goal of nutrition security, that is, ensuring that households can access and afford diverse, nutritious foods throughout the year. A diversification of the cropping system in Bihar stands to benefit smallholder farmers by ensuring the supply of nonstaples essential for nutritional security. The predominantly rice–wheat cropping system can be diversified by introducing intercropping of pulses using high-yielding, short duration seeds in a rice–lentil system in the rice fallow regions in high residual moisture zones. Similarly, the cultivation of hybrid varieties on raised beds in flood-prone districts in Bihar can further diversify the production of maize, which has one of the highest productivity levels in Bihar. Additionally, the growth in fruits and vegetables needs to be sustained, and even improved, with supporting investments in postharvest, cold-storage infrastructure to limit losses of these perishable products. For livestock, efforts should focus on improved breeds in order to realize higher yields of animal-sourced foods, like milk and meats. Promoting Makhana (fox nut) and fishery-based farming systems in north Bihar would also diversify cropping systems, as well as make fish available for consumption.\nThe move toward a diversified production system must not exclude women. They can influence the modifications of the mix of crops cultivated both for consumption by their households, as well as for sale in the market. Focusing on women farmers is also a key component of SDG2.3. A diversification of the production system can also potentially increase smallholder incomes if supported by adequate market linkages and infrastructure investments.\n\n3. Bihar’s Food Safety Nets Should Be Leveraged\nAs channels for ensuring that nutrient-rich nonstaples are available to households for increased consumption.\nImprovements in yields and a diversified basket of agricultural produce can contribute to an increase in the supply of diverse, micronutrient-rich foods in Bihar’s food safety net programs, namely the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), Mid-Day Meal (MDM), and the Public Distribution System (PDS). This will require a convergence between the objectives and activities of the Departments of Women and Child Development; Education; Health; and Food and Consumer Protection. For example, small fish, green leafy vegetables, and biofortified crops, such as high-zinc rice and wheat, high-iron pulses, and orange-fleshed sweet potatoes (OFSP) could be grown by the Jeevika groups and procured for Anganwadi child care centers, schools, and the PDS. Milk fortified with vitamins A and D could be supplied in collaboration with Sudha Dairy. Take Home Rations (THR), prepared and supplied by Jeevika groups to the Anganwadi, could be scaled up under appropriate food safety regulations for use in locally processed food. This would provide a boost to the local economy and ensure livelihoods for women. Animal-sourced foods, like eggs and milk, and diversified crops, like pulses and Nutri Millets, can be procured by the Food and Consumer Protection Department for consumption in Anganwadi centers and schools. The PDS can also be made more nutrition-sensitive by working toward decentralized procurement and supply of millets, pulses, and other biofortified crops by the Department of Food and Consumer Protection and the Food Corporation of India.\n\n4. Women’s Empowerment is a Pathway for Increasing\nDemand for micronutrient-rich foods for household consumption.\nWomen’s empowerment is a strong channel for ensuring that there is an increased demand for micronutrient-rich foods for household consumption. Ensuring women’s access to productive resources in agriculture (like land, irrigation, and credit) and enabling them to have greater input in decisions related to production, use of income, and time use are some areas where interventions can be targeted to empower women in agriculture. Women can be part of the move toward diversified production systems, such as the farming of nutrition-rich crops like pulses and millets, maintenance of kitchen gardens, and management of livestock/poultry/fisheries through the Jeevika groups already present in Bihar. The Departments of Agriculture and of Animal Husbandry and Fisheries can provide technical support to the Jeevika groups in their efforts toward diversification of farming systems. Rural development departments can use the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 2005 (Ministry of Rural Development) program to help landless people and women get work on projects that could transform the soil and water conservation situation across the state, especially in the drier regions of south Bihar. Women need to be linked to markets by way of information (on prices, for example), infrastructure (roads, transport), and institutional arrangements like self-help groups or FPOs, which result in better price realization because of collective bargaining power. These avenues can result in both an increased supply of micronutrient-rich foods and increased incomes for women. The latter, in turn, can increase demand for such foods.\nWomen can also play an important role in influencing intra-household food allocation. Positive nutrition behavior campaigns that address allocation can be implemented by bringing together government departments, development sector organizations, and public and private sector companies that have a presence in Bihar. More than 900,000 women’s self-help groups have been formed across Bihar.
