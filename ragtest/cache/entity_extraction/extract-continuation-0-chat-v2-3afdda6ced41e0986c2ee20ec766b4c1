There is not adequate staff, laboratories, clinics, and other essential teaching tools which are crucial for preparing students in these professions. There is discontent regarding the proportional allocation of resources between agricultural sciences and veterinary sciences. Addressing these issues, a new veterinary university in the State of Bihar may be set up to produce the desired manpower with adequate skill.\n(ii) There should be some continuing education programs in these professions through regular training courses.\n(iii) Human resource development should be given very high priority in livestock development to meet the qualitative and quantitative shortage of manpower. Optimal requirements of human resources to support various programs need to be worked out and steps taken to generate the same through the involvement of NGOs and the private sector.\nStrategy for Fisheries & Aquaculture\nBihar has rich inland fishery resources in the form of rivers and canals (3,200 km), reservoirs (7,200 ha), floodplain wetlands (5,000 ha of Oxbow Lakes and 48,000 ha of chaurs), and ponds (65,000 ha). The average fish production in ponds under FFDA is 2.2 tonnes/ha/year. The state produces 2.66 lakh tonnes of fish annually, but the constraints for realizing higher production levels are access to inputs including seed and feed in production areas, low stocking of floodplain lakes and reservoirs, and market connectivity. The following strategy is suggested for the state:\nReservoirs Fisheries Development\n(i) Bihar’s reservoirs account for 0.60 lakh ha. The contribution from reservoirs of the State in total fish production is very low, with an average productivity level of only 5 kg/ha. The productivity ranges from 1.5 to 7.5 kg/ha. Based on the nutrient status of these reservoirs vis-à-vis scientific technologies available in the country, production levels of 30 kg/ha in large, 50 kg/ha in medium, and 200-1000 kg/ha in small reservoirs could easily be achieved by judicious and systematic efforts. Some intricate issues, particularly managerial, such as the presence of carnivorous fishes, tree stumps, dense macrophytes, poor fishery management practices, unregulated destructive types of fishing, sick Fisheries Cooperative Societies (FCS), lack of adequate harvest, post-harvest, and market infrastructure facilities, should be circumvented to raise production levels from these water bodies from abysmally very low levels at present. Other measures that should be put in place include strict enforcement of management rules, observance of closed seasons, providing training and fishing tools to fishermen, intensive extension practices, and observing ethics of responsible fisheries.\n(ii) Recent policy decisions to declare aquaculture on par with agriculture to avail various subsidies and making aquaculture income tax-free are laudable steps. Decisions to privatize the fish seed production infrastructure would further need the empowerment of the clients to be able to mortgage the land and buildings for raising funds from financial institutions. For this purpose, a series of rules and regulations would need to be implemented.\n(iii) Fisheries Cooperative Societies (FCS) should be made financially and technically strong to meet the challenging post-harvest activities and play a viable role in fish trade and diversification of activities. The present system of auctioning and leasing of the reservoir fisheries rights is highly detrimental in the long term and should be replaced by the cooperative and SHG system. Hence, management of reservoirs by fishermen cooperatives/SHGs located around the reservoirs should be promoted to increase the efficiency and production levels and improve the socio-economic status of the fisherfolk dependent on these resources for their livelihood. Since almost all reservoirs in the State are of small and medium category, they can be used as a modified extensive culture system, which will enhance/increase fish production in these water bodies.\n(iv) Further, the poor marketing infrastructure has also depleted the incentives and returns of the fishermen. Therefore, a package approach comprising stocking, monitoring, equitable and just royalty arrangements, market intervention through cooperatives/corporations, and quick transport/distribution channels should be evolved. While the irrigation department could continue to manage the headworks and the canals, the management of the water resource for fisheries in terms of stocking, exploitation, conservation, and fishing rights should be brought under the exclusive control of the State Fisheries Department if the production and productivity of fisheries in reservoirs are to be raised.\n(v) A micro-plan should be developed for fisheries development in all reservoirs, through which the fish production level of the major reservoirs could easily be raised from the present production to a minimum of 50 kg per ha for medium reservoirs and 200 kg per ha for small reservoirs by 2020.\n\nPolicy Issues for Fisheries and Aquaculture\n233. Lack of appropriate leasing policy over the years has been one of the major factors of the ineffective utilization and development of these water bodies for aquaculture. Though certain positive initiatives have been taken by the government in the form of the Bihar Fish Jalkar Management Act 2006 for short and long term leasing of these community water bodies, it needs effective implementation at Gram Panchayat levels. Community approach for integrated development shall aid in the development of aquaculture in these ponds.\n(i) For the development of the inland waters, fishing rights must be with the State Fisheries Department. The lease amount should be rationalized with\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>STATE OF BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India with a college of Veterinary Science and Animal Husbandry, facing resource crunch and considering the establishment of a new veterinary university to address manpower shortages in livestock development and veterinary sciences)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COLLEGE OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An educational institution in Bihar suffering from inadequate staff, laboratories, clinics, and teaching tools, leading to discontent over resource allocation between agricultural and veterinary sciences)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW VETERINARY UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A proposed educational institution in Bihar aimed at producing skilled manpower in veterinary sciences)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NGOS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Non-governmental organizations involved in human resource development in livestock development in Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRIVATE SECTOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Private industry stakeholders involved in human resource development in livestock development in Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FISHERIES COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES (FCS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Societies that should be financially and technically strengthened to improve post-harvest activities, fish trade, and diversification in Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STATE FISHERIES DEPARTMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The department suggested to have exclusive control over stocking, exploitation, conservation, and fishing rights to raise production and productivity of fisheries in reservoirs in Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR FISH JALKAR MANAGEMENT ACT 2006<|>EVENT<|>An act for short and long term leasing of community water bodies for aquaculture development in Bihar, requiring effective implementation at Gram Panchayat levels)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STATE OF BIHAR<|>COLLEGE OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY<|>The College of Veterinary Science and Animal Husbandry is located in the State of Bihar and is facing a resource crunch<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STATE OF BIHAR<|>NEW VETERINARY UNIVERSITY<|>A new veterinary university may be established in the State of Bihar to address the shortage of skilled manpower<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COLLEGE OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY<|>NEW VETERINARY UNIVERSITY<|>The new veterinary university is proposed to address the issues faced by the College of Veterinary Science and Animal Husbandry<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NGOS<|>PRIVATE SECTOR<|>NGOs and the private sector are involved together in human resource development in livestock development in Bihar<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FISHERIES COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES (FCS)<|>STATE FISHERIES DEPARTMENT<|>FCS should be strengthened with the help of the State Fisheries Department to improve fisheries management in Bihar<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STATE FISHERIES DEPARTMENT<|>BIHAR FISH JALKAR MANAGEMENT ACT 2006<|>The State Fisheries Department is suggested to have control over fishing rights as per the Bihar Fish Jalkar Management Act 2006<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
