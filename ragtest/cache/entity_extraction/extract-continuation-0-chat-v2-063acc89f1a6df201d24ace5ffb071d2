It remained stagnant around 1.35 lakh hectares until 1986-87. By 1992-93, the area had expanded to 1.71 lakh hectares. The trend rate of growth was 1.85% during 1971-93, with 3.03% in the first sub-period and 2.49% in the second. Compared to other major potato-growing states, Bihar's growth rate was lower. Uttar Pradesh had a rate of 2.79%, West Bengal 6.23%, and Bihar 2.39% during 1983-93. The national average was 5.60%.\nIV.9.8 Regional Pattern of Area Expansion\nThe north-west plains had a higher share of area under potato. Notable districts with high shares included:\nNorth-West Plains: East Champaran (4.64%), Samastipur (4.62%), Saran (4.20%)\nEast Plains: Purnea (6.49%), Saharsa (4.42%)\nSouth-West Plains: Gaya (4.68%)\nPlateau Zone: Hazaribagh (6.93%), Ranchi (5.45%)\nTrend rates of growth in area showed significant variation:\nNorth-West Alluvial Plains: Increasing trend at 0.60%\nEast Alluvial Plains: Increasing trend at 2.20%\nPlateau Region: Declining trend at (-7.93%)\nSouth-West Alluvial Plains: Declining trend at (-1.93%)\nThe south-west alluvial plains experienced a reversal from a decline of (-5.30%) in the first sub-period to an increase of 0.22% in the second sub-period. The plateau region saw a slowdown in growth from 2.41% to 1.77%. The north-west and east alluvial plains recorded acceleration in area growth during the second sub-period. Less dominant potato-growing districts such as Darbhanga (5.68%), West Champaran (6.43%), Katihar (6.10%), and Palamu (4.52%) showed higher growth rates. Major districts like Madhubani (3.27%), Begusarai (10.47%), Purnea (3.06%), and Saharsa (3.00%) also expanded in area, while Saran, Nalanda, and Nawadah experienced a shrinking trend.\nIV.9.9 Yield of Potato\nThe yield of potato in Bihar declined from 11.11 tonnes/ha. in 1970-71 to around 8-10 tonnes/ha. until 1992-93. The trend rate of growth in yield during 1971-93 was 0.43% per annum, with negative rates of (-1.01%) in the first sub-period and (-0.20%) in the second. Bihar’s yield of 9.15 tonnes/ha. in 1990-93 was considerably lower compared to Gujarat (24.98 tonnes/ha.), West Bengal (22.09 tonnes/ha.), Uttar Pradesh (17.17 tonnes/ha.), and the national average of 13.51 tonnes/ha.\n\nIV.9.10 Analysis of Growth Trends in Potato Cultivation\nAnalysis further revealed that the trend rates of growth in area varied widely across different agro-climatic zones. It showed an increasing trend during 1977-91 in the:\nNorth-West Alluvial Plains: 0.60%\nEast Alluvial Plains: 2.20%\nConversely, the:\nPlateau Region: -7.93%\nSouth-West Alluvial Plains: -1.93%\nrecorded a declining trend. Analyzing the trend rates of growth across two sub-periods:\nSouth-West Alluvial Plains: Witnessed a reversal from a declining trend in the first sub-period (-5.30%) to an increasing trend in the second sub-period (0.22%).\nPlateau Region: Experienced a slowdown in the increasing trend rate of growth from 2.41% to 1.77%.\nNorth-West Alluvial Plains and East Alluvial Plains: Recorded acceleration in area increase during the second sub-period.\nAcross different districts, the area under potato showed relatively higher growth rates in less dominant potato-growing districts. Such districts included:\nDarbhanga: 5.68%\nWest Champaran: 6.43%\nKatihar: 6.10%\nPalamu: 4.52%\nAmong the major potato-growing districts:\nMadhubani: 3.27%\nBegusarai: 10.47%\nPurnea: 3.06%\nSaharsa: 3.00%\nshowed expansion of area, whereas:\nSaran\nNalanda\nNawadah\nshowed a shrinking trend.\nIII) Yield of Potato\nThe yield of potato was declining in Bihar. It was:\n11.11 tonnes/ha in 1970-71\nDeclined thereafter with yield levels hovering around 8-10 tonnes/ha until 1992-93.\nThe trend rate of growth in yield during 1971-93 was 0.43% per annum. However, it was observed to be negative when separately analyzed for the two sub-periods:\nFirst Sub-Period: Rate of decline was (-)1.01%\nSecond Sub-Period: Rate of decline was (-)0.20%\nWhen compared with the national average and those in the major potato-growing states, it was disappointingly low at:\n9.15 tonnes/ha in Bihar\n24.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India that has seen varying trends in potato cultivation area and yield over the years, with a general trend of growth in area but declining yield)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UTTAR PRADESH<|>GEO<|>A major potato-growing state in India with a growth rate of 2.79% during 1983-93)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEST BENGAL<|>GEO<|>A major potato-growing state in India with the highest growth rate of 6.23% during 1983-93)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GUJARAT<|>GEO<|>State in India noted for having a high potato yield of 24.98 tonnes/ha during 1990-93)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EAST CHAMPARAN<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with a high share of area under potato cultivation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMASTIPUR<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with a significant share of area under potato cultivation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SARAN<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with a notable share of area under potato, experiencing a shrinking trend in cultivation area)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PURNEA<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with the highest share of area under potato in the East Plains and showing expansion in area)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAHARSA<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with a significant share of area under potato in the East Plains and showing expansion in area)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAYA<|>GEO<|>District in the South-West Plains of Bihar with a notable share of area under potato)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAZARIBAGH<|>GEO<|>District in the Plateau Zone of Bihar with the highest growth rate in area under potato)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RANCHI<|>GEO<|>District in the Plateau Zone of Bihar with a significant growth rate in area under potato)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DARBHANGA<|>GEO<|>Less dominant potato-growing district in Bihar with a higher growth rate)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEST CHAMPARAN<|>GEO<|>Less dominant potato-growing district in Bihar with a high growth rate)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KATIHAR<|>GEO<|>Less dominant potato-growing district in Bihar with a high growth rate)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PALAMU<|>GEO<|>Less dominant potato-growing district in Bihar with a notable growth rate)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MADHUBANI<|>GEO<|>Major potato-growing district in Bihar showing expansion in area)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEGUSARAI<|>GEO<|>Major potato-growing district in Bihar with the highest growth rate among major districts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NALANDA<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar experiencing a shrinking trend in potato cultivation area)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAWADAH<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar showing a shrinking trend in potato cultivation area)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>UTTAR PRADESH<|>Bihar's growth rate in potato cultivation area was lower compared to Uttar Pradesh<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>WEST BENGAL<|>Bihar's growth rate in potato cultivation area was significantly lower compared to West Bengal<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>GUJARAT<|>Bihar's potato yield was considerably lower compared to Gujarat<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PURNEA<|>BIHAR<|>Purnea is a district in Bihar with a high share and growth rate of area under potato<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAHARSA<|>BIHAR<|>Saharsa is a district in Bihar with a significant share and growth rate of area under potato<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SARAN<|>BIHAR<|>Saran, experiencing a shrinking trend, is a district in Bihar with a notable share of area under potato<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BEGUSARAI<|>BIHAR<|>Begusarai, with the highest growth rate among major districts, is a major potato-growing district in Bihar<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
