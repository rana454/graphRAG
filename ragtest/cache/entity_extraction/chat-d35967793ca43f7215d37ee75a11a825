The incidence of government procurement is negligible in Bihar – only about 3 percent of the rice and wheat output is procured by the government.\nAlthough the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act has been repealed in Bihar in 2006 with the objective of facilitating free trade, infrastructure to support a competitive market is grossly lacking, thereby making farmers worse off. Because there is no physical market or mandis in Bihar, farmers have to pay commission, marketing, and other charges to intermediaries. Further, poor power infrastructure has resulted in high dependency on diesel for pumping out groundwater for irrigation, depressing returns from the cultivation of crops. If the cost of pumping out groundwater using a diesel pump is about Rs 75-80 per hour (due to the increase in petroleum prices in recent years), the cost of pumping out groundwater using an electric pump is just Rs 8-9 per hour. As per our estimates, this dependence on diesel for irrigation instead of electric pumps raises the cost of cultivation by Rs 7,000 to 8,000 per hectare for paddy in Bihar. The study also finds that strategic deficiencies have constrained livestock development. For instance, poor quality of breeds and poor health and reproduction management of dairy animals are major problems. Further, poultry development has not taken off in Bihar because of the poor adoption of the model of contract farming as done in states like Andhra Pradesh and Odisha.\n\n \n1. Introduction\nOver the past 60 years, Indian agriculture has made remarkable progress in food grain production. During this time, India has transformed from a food-deficit nation to a food-surplus country, despite the population increasing from 361 million to 1.2 billion. The country has also diversified its agriculture from cereals to high-value commodities. India is now the world's second-largest producer of wheat, rice, fruits, vegetables, and cotton, as well as the largest producer of milk and pulses. However, agricultural development has been uneven across states. While states like Punjab (during the early Green Revolution), Gujarat, and more recently, Madhya Pradesh have capitalized on growth opportunities, others like Odisha and Uttar Pradesh have lagged behind in several development indicators. Bihar, on the other hand, has recorded a high agricultural growth rate in recent years compared to other states. Between 2005-06 and 2014-15, Bihar's agricultural sector grew at 5.6 percent, compared to the national average of 3.6 percent. However, this growth rate has been extremely volatile due to recurring natural disasters and is highly sensitive to the choice of the initial and final years. Moreover, productivity in agricultural crops remains low compared to the national average despite the significant use of productivity-enhancing inputs such as fertilizers, quality certified seeds, and farm machinery. Dairy development has also shown impressive growth, yet milk productivity lags behind that of major milk-producing states in India. This paper explores the reasons behind this paradox of low agricultural productivity and high input usage in crops, as well as robust expansion but low productivity in dairy, while analyzing the sources and drivers of agricultural growth in Bihar.\nIn Section 2, we discuss the data sources and methodology used in the study. Section 3 provides a description of the geographical and demographic features, as well as the land and water resources of the state, while briefly reviewing natural calamities that have afflicted agriculture. Section 4 examines the composition and sources of agricultural growth in the state. In Section 5, we discuss the status of physical infrastructure in Bihar and the drivers of agricultural growth using econometric analysis. Section 6 concludes with recommendations for policy interventions that would stimulate and sustain agricultural growth in the state.\n2. Data and Methodology\nThe study uses secondary data compiled from various published sources, covering the period from 2000-01 to 2014-15. We analyze and compare Bihar's performance against that of other states. For comparison, we have selected two sub-groups of three comparator states each: the first comprising Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Punjab, and the second, Bihar, Odisha, and Uttar Pradesh. Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh have experienced rapid agricultural growth in the past decade, while Punjab achieved high growth during the Green Revolution. Bihar, Odisha, and Uttar Pradesh are considered moderately performing states due to their poor agricultural growth and high poverty rates.\nTo examine the composition of agriculture, we calculated the share of the value of output from different segments as a percentage of the total value of output from agriculture and allied activities. To study the sources of growth, we deflated the current series of each segment by the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) at 2004-05 prices and then decomposed the year-on-year growth in the gross value of output from agriculture and allied activities (GVOA) by taking the absolute year-on-year difference in GVO from each segment as a proportion of the previous year’s GVO from agriculture and allied activities.\nThe drivers of growth were analyzed using a three-step procedure to estimate the association between agricultural growth and selected control variables. First, we tested if the natural logarithm of the selected variables was integrated of the same order using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. Based on the outcome of the test, in the second stage, we determined if the series were co-integrated (i.e., testing for a long-term relationship between the variables) using Engle and Granger’s (1986) two-stage residual-based method. This method was adopted because we are interested in the elasticity of the explanatory variables. Accordingly, we first ran an ordinary least square model to analyze the determinants of agricultural growth in Bihar and then performed a unit root test on the residuals of the model to examine if it was stationary.
