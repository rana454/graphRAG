The east alluvial plains had a growth rate of 2.66%, and the plateau region showed a decline of -2.77% per annum. The north-west and south-west alluvial plains showed a comparatively higher growth rate than the east alluvial plains and plateau regions. The rate of increase in production of wheat during the second sub-period (1983-91) in the north-west alluvial plains and south-west alluvial plains was comparatively high at 5.0% and 4.8%, respectively.\nIV.3.4 Instability in Wheat Production\nThe coefficient of variation in wheat production in Bihar for the period 1971-93 was 8.81%. The coefficient of variation was higher in the plateau region (16.28%) and relatively lower in the north-west (8.34%) and south-west (9.35%) alluvial plains. District-wise, instability was higher in Gopalganj, Samastipur, Sitamarhi, Katihar, and Dhanbad.\nIV.3.5 Acceleration/Deceleration in Wheat Production\nThe rate of acceleration in wheat production during 1977-91 varied across zones:\nNorth-west Alluvial Plains: 0.39% per annum\nSouth-west Alluvial Plains: 0.17% per annum\nPlateau: 0.44% per annum\nEast Alluvial Plains: 0.09% per annum\nIV.3.6 Area Under Wheat\nThe area under wheat expanded from 6.39 lakh hectares in 1960-61 to 19.96 lakh hectares in 1992-93, recording a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.59%. The growth rate in area was relatively high at 2.22% per annum during 1960-61 to 1982-83 but showed a slowdown to 1.34% per annum during 1983-93. Bihar's area expansion in wheat cultivation was significantly higher compared to states like Assam, Gujarat, and Maharashtra, which experienced a decline in the area under wheat during the 1980s.\nIV.3.7 Regional Pattern\nAcross different zones, the north-west (39.25%) and south-west (34.16%) showed relatively high area under wheat. Districts such as Rohtas (9.99%), Bhojpur (7.11%), and Gaya (4.79%) in the south-west; Purnea (5.26%), Saharsa (5.22%), and Begusarai (5.04%) in the east; and East Champaran (5.05%), Gopalganj (4.80%), Saran (4.70%), and Siwan (4.71%) in the north-west had relatively high proportions of the total wheat area in the state.\nIV.3.8 Trend in Area Under Wheat\nIn the first sub-period, all agro-climatic zones of Bihar, except the south-west plains, showed a declining trend in area under wheat. The rate of decline was as high as -6.30% in the plateau zones. In the north-west and east plains, the rate of decline was -1.60% and -1.30%, respectively. The south-west plains showed an increasing trend at 1.90% per annum. In the second sub-period, all zones showed an increased trend in area under wheat, with the east plains showing the highest increase at 3.39%, followed by the north-west (2.45%) and south-west (2.28%) plains. The plateau zone also showed a marginal increase of 0.07%. The plateau zone’s reversal from a declining rate to an increasing trend in area under wheat was a significant development. Growth in area was relatively high in districts less dominant in wheat production, including Begusarai (5.80%), Purnea (6.43%), Darbhanga (4.38%), Sitamarhi (4.85%), Nalanda (5.37%), and Hazaribagh (5.56%).\nIV.3.9 Yield of Wheat\nPart of the increase in wheat production in the state could be attributed to an impressive increase in yield. The yield increased from 644 kg/ha in 1958-61 to 1790 kg/ha in 1990-93, recording a compound annual rate of growth of 3.2%. The yield during the first sub-period showed increasing trends but with wide year-to-year fluctuations, hovering around 1250 kg/ha. The second sub-period showed a more stable and consistent increase in yield, reaching 1820 kg/ha in 1991-92. The trend rate of growth in yield of wheat for the period 1971-93 was 1.77% per annum. The pace of increase in yield became faster during the second sub-period at 2.19% per annum compared to 0.46% per annum during the first sub-period.\nIV.3.10 Regional Pattern\nDespite the accelerated rate of growth, the yield of wheat in Bihar at 1790 kg/ha in 1990-93 was below the national average of 2330 kg/ha. It was much less than the yield level in Haryana (3570 kg/ha) and Punjab (3760 kg/ha). The pace of increase in yield level also lagged behind in Bihar, with a growth rate of 2.80% per annum during 1983-93 compared to the national average of 3.14%. Haryana showed a faster pace of increase at 4.0% per annum during the same period.\nIV.3.11 Trend in Yield of Wheat\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NORTH-WEST ALLUVIAL PLAINS<|>GEO<|>Region in Bihar showing a high growth rate in wheat production and a significant area under wheat cultivation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTH-WEST ALLUVIAL PLAINS<|>GEO<|>Region in Bihar with a high growth rate in wheat production and a large area dedicated to wheat cultivation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EAST ALLUVIAL PLAINS<|>GEO<|>Region in Bihar with a growth rate in wheat production and a considerable area under wheat cultivation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLATEAU REGION<|>GEO<|>Region in Bihar that initially showed a decline in wheat production area but later showed a marginal increase)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>State in India experiencing varied growth rates and trends in wheat production across its different regions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOPALGANJ<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with higher instability in wheat production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMASTIPUR<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with higher instability in wheat production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SITAMARHI<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with higher instability in wheat production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KATIHAR<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with higher instability in wheat production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DHANBAD<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with higher instability in wheat production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROHTAS<|>GEO<|>District in the south-west of Bihar with a high proportion of the total wheat area in the state)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BHOJPUR<|>GEO<|>District in the south-west of Bihar with a significant proportion of the total wheat area in the state)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAYA<|>GEO<|>District in the south-west of Bihar contributing to the wheat cultivation area)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PURNIA<|>GEO<|>District in the east of Bihar with a notable proportion of the total wheat area in the state)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAHARSA<|>GEO<|>District in the east of Bihar contributing significantly to the wheat cultivation area)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEGUSARAI<|>GEO<|>District in the east of Bihar with a considerable wheat cultivation area)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EAST CHAMPARAN<|>GEO<|>District in the north-west of Bihar with a significant wheat cultivation area)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SARAN<|>GEO<|>District in the north-west of Bihar contributing to the wheat cultivation area)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIWAN<|>GEO<|>District in the north-west of Bihar with a notable wheat cultivation area)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DARBHANGA<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with a high growth in area under wheat during the second sub-period)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NALANDA<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with a significant increase in area under wheat during the second sub-period)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAZARIBAGH<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar showing a high growth in area under wheat during the second sub-period)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NORTH-WEST ALLUVIAL PLAINS<|>BIHAR<|>The North-West Alluvial Plains are a significant agricultural region within Bihar, showing high growth in wheat production<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOUTH-WEST ALLUVIAL PLAINS<|>BIHAR<|>The South-West Alluvial Plains are a key agricultural area in Bihar with a large area under wheat cultivation<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EAST ALLUVIAL PLAINS<|>BIHAR<|>The East Alluvial Plains contribute to Bihar's wheat production with a considerable cultivation area<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLATEAU REGION<|>BIHAR<|>The Plateau Region in Bihar initially showed a decline in wheat production area but later experienced a marginal increase<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOPALGANJ<|>BIHAR<|>Gopalganj is a district in Bihar noted for its higher instability in wheat production<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROHTAS<|>BIHAR<|>Rohtas is a significant district in Bihar's south-west with a high proportion of the state's total wheat area<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DARBHANGA<|>BIHAR<|>Darbhanga is a district in Bihar that showed a high growth in area under wheat during the second sub-period<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
