For example, the production of foodgrains in kharif season was 5472.43 thousand tonnes in 1980-83, which increased to 5805.73 thousand tonnes in 1990-93 in the state. It grew at 0.59% per annum only. On the other hand, production of foodgrains in rabi season increased from 3016.37 thousand tonnes in 1980-83 to 4882.63 thousand tonnes in 1990-93, growing annually at 4.93%. Increase in foodgrains production in rabi season in Bihar during the eighties was comparable to that in Haryana (4.99%). It was even more than the growth rate achieved by Punjab (3.61%) during this period. However, it was much less than the increase experienced by West Bengal (8.66%) in rabi foodgrains production during the eighties.\nZone-wise/District-wise Spatial Analysis\n111.5 Zone-wise/district-wise analysis of triennial average production of foodgrains (1988-91) as also share of different districts to state total or zone total suggests that districts such as Purnea in the east plains, and Rohtas and Bhojpur in the south-west emerged as the major granaries of the State with a share in state foodgrains production at 5.14%, 7.30%, and 5.65% respectively. East Champaran, Saharsa, Gaya, Nalanda, Patna, Santhal Parganas, and Ranchi produced equally high levels of foodgrains with each of these districts having a share of around 4.0% or more in State foodgrains output. On the other hand, districts such as Vaishali, Katihar, Nawadah, Giridih, Hazaribagh, and Palamu produced less than 2.0% of the total State foodgrains production.\n111.6 Analysis of zone-wise/district-wise trend growth rates in production of foodgrains as also detrended coefficient of variation and rate of acceleration/deceleration over the period from 1976-77 to 1990-91 further suggests that there was a distinct pattern of increase in foodgrains production across different zones. The plateau region showed a declining trend in output of food crops at a compound annual growth rate of (-)0.71% per annum. The other zones, viz., north-west alluvial plains, East alluvial plains, and South-west alluvial plains, on the other hand, showed positive growth rates at 2.18%, 1.36%, and 2.51% respectively during the same period. It was relatively less in the east-alluvial plains at 1.36%.\n111.7 Analyzing the growth performance separately for two sub-periods, it was observed that the plateau districts which had a negative trend in the growth of foodgrains production during the first sub-period showed an impressive reversal to positive growth at 3.27% per annum in the second sub-period. The south-west alluvial plains reached accelerated growth rate at 5.74% per annum during the second sub-period. The zones of north-west alluvial plains and east alluvial plains also experienced similar expansion in the output of foodgrains at 4.53% and 4.64% respectively during the second sub-period.\na) North-West Alluvial Plains\n111.8 Among the eleven districts falling in this zone, only two districts, namely Sitamarhi and Samastipur, had growth performance (0.10% and 1.35%) less than the state average (1.55%) during 1977-91. All other districts, namely West Champaran, East Champaran, Gopalganj, Siwan, Saran, Vaishali, Muzaffarpur, Darbhanga, and Madhubani had some degree of homogeneity in growth performance, exceeding the state average. The districts of East Champaran and Siwan had still better performance levels with growth rates exceeding 3.0%. However, if the growth pattern is separately seen for the two sub-periods, it is striking to observe that most of the districts showed accelerated levels of growth rate during the second sub-period compared to the first sub-period. The rate of expansion in the second sub-period was, however, more in respect of districts such as East Champaran (4.90%), Madhubani (6.89%), Samastipur (5.43%), Gopalganj (4.64%), and Siwan (4.57%). These districts formed one homogenous geographical cluster.\nb) East Alluvial Plains\n111.9 The districts of this zone presented a different picture in terms of growth performance during 1977-91. While Munger showed a declining trend in output (-0.07%), districts of Purnea, Katihar, and Bhagalpur experienced positive growth. Saharsa showed relatively better performance levels (1.73%) exceeding even the state average. Begusarai offered a picture in contrast with growth rate at more than 5.0% per annum. The scenario took an upturn from 1983-84 among the districts of this zone as well. Of the six districts falling under this zone, three districts, namely Munger, Purnea, and Saharsa, showed growth rates exceeding 5.0% during this period. Even Katihar, which showed negative growth performance during the first sub-period, took a positive turn, growing at 2.81% per annum. Begusarai and Bhagalpur also showed modest increases at 3.92% and 3.48% respectively.\nc) South-West Alluv\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>KHARIF SEASON<|>EVENT<|>A season in which the production of foodgrains was observed, with specific production figures mentioned for years 1980-83 and 1990-93 in the state)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RABI SEASON<|>EVENT<|>A season noted for its increased production of foodgrains from 1980-83 to 1990-93, with a significant annual growth rate mentioned)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>State mentioned in the context of foodgrains production, comparing its growth rates with other states)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARYANA<|>GEO<|>State mentioned for its comparable increase in foodgrains production during the eighties to that of Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUNJAB<|>GEO<|>State referenced for its growth rate in foodgrains production during the eighties, compared to Bihar and other states)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEST BENGAL<|>GEO<|>State noted for its significant increase in rabi foodgrains production during the eighties, surpassing the growth rates of Bihar, Punjab, and Haryana)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PURNEA<|>GEO<|>District in the east plains of the state, identified as a major granary with a specific share in state foodgrains production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROHTAS<|>GEO<|>District in the south-west, highlighted as a major granary of the State with a notable share in foodgrains production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BHOJPUR<|>GEO<|>Another district in the south-west, emerging as a major granary with a significant contribution to the state's foodgrains production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EAST CHAMPARAN<|>GEO<|>District mentioned for producing high levels of foodgrains, with a share of around 4.0% or more in State foodgrains output)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORTH-WEST ALLUVIAL PLAINS<|>GEO<|>Zone mentioned for its positive growth rates in foodgrains production, with specific districts exceeding the state average growth)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EAST ALLUVIAL PLAINS<|>GEO<|>Zone with varied growth performance among its districts, some exceeding state average growth rates in foodgrains production)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KHARIF SEASON<|>BIHAR<|>The Kharif season's production figures are specifically mentioned for Bihar, indicating the state's agricultural activity during this period<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RABI SEASON<|>BIHAR<|>The Rabi season's increased production and growth rates are discussed in the context of Bihar's agricultural performance<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>HARYANA<|>Bihar's growth rate in foodgrains production during the eighties is compared to that of Haryana<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>PUNJAB<|>The text compares the growth rate in foodgrains production of Bihar with Punjab<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>WEST BENGAL<|>Bihar's growth rate in foodgrains production is compared to the significantly higher rate experienced by West Bengal<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PURNEA<|>BIHAR<|>Purnea is identified as a significant contributor to Bihar's state foodgrains production<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROHTAS<|>BIHAR<|>Rohtas is highlighted for its major contribution to the foodgrains production in Bihar<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BHOJPUR<|>BIHAR<|>Bhojpur's role as a major granary contributes significantly to Bihar's overall foodgrains production<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NORTH-WEST ALLUVIAL PLAINS<|>BIHAR<|>This zone's growth performance in foodgrains production is discussed within the context of Bihar's agricultural landscape<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EAST ALLUVIAL PLAINS<|>BIHAR<|>The East Alluvial Plains' growth in foodgrains production is analyzed in relation to Bihar's overall agricultural performance<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
