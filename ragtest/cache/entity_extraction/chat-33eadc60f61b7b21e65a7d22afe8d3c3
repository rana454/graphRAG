North Bihar, where around 76 percent of the population resides, is subject to recurring floods. The rivers of North Bihar, with 65 percent of their large catchment areas in the Himalayas in Nepal/Tibet, cause floods in around 74 percent of its geographical area. These rivers carry large amounts of water and a very high sediment load, which is deposited in the plains of Bihar (Water Resource Department, Bihar). Between 2000 and 2015, Bihar experienced severe floods in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2007, 2008, and 2013. According to data from the Flood Management Information System of Bihar, between 2004 and 2013, 4 million hectares of cropped area, 71.1 million population, and 23 million houses were affected. In contrast to the excess water in North Bihar, South Bihar faces water shortages. In fact, the two climatic risks that most affect agriculture in Bihar are floods and droughts. Around 40 percent of the area in South Bihar is classified as drought-prone. There were severe droughts in 2002, 2009, 2010, and 2013.\n4. Composition and Sources of Agricultural Growth\n4.1 Agricultural Composition\nThe agricultural economy of Bihar is a combination of both subsistence and commercialized agriculture. In TE 2013-14, the total value of output from agriculture and allied activities was estimated at around Rs. 1.2 lakh crore at current prices, of which crop production accounted for 80 percent, followed by livestock (17 percent), fishing (3 percent), and forestry and logging (less than 1 percent). Rice and wheat are the major food grains grown in the state, occupying 3.2 million hectares (36.6 percent) and 2.1 million hectares (24.7 percent) of the gross cropped area (GCA) in TE 2013-14, respectively. While rice is a Kharif crop, wheat is cultivated in the Rabi season. The state also grows maize, pulses, oilseeds, fruits, and vegetables, with increasing diversification towards horticulture. In TE 2013-14, the share of fruits and vegetables in the total GCA was around 16 percent.\nLivestock plays a vital role in the rural economy of Bihar, particularly for small and marginal farmers and landless agricultural laborers. The state ranks first in the country in terms of the density of livestock population per 1,000 hectares, and it has the second-largest cattle population after Uttar Pradesh. In 2012, Bihar had 33 million livestock, of which cattle and buffalo constituted around 60 percent of the population. The state has also witnessed growth in milk production, with the highest average annual growth rate of 9 percent between 2001-02 and 2012-13, against the national average of 4.4 percent (GoI 2015a). Despite the growth, milk productivity remains lower than in other major milk-producing states such as Punjab and Gujarat.\n4.2 Sources of Agricultural Growth\nThe decomposition of agricultural growth reveals that crop production has been the major driver of growth in Bihar. Between 2000-01 and 2014-15, crop production contributed around 60 percent to overall agricultural growth, followed by livestock at 29 percent, and fishing and forestry combined contributed 11 percent. The major source of growth in crop production has been the expansion in the area under cultivation and the improvement in yield levels. However, yield levels in major crops, especially rice and wheat, are still lower than the national average and significantly below those in Punjab, Gujarat, and Madhya Pradesh. The high growth in livestock has been driven by an increase in the population of cattle and buffaloes, particularly in the number of crossbred cattle. Milk production in the state has grown by 8.8 percent per annum between 2000-01 and 2014-15.\n5. Physical Infrastructure and Drivers of Growth\n5.1 Physical Infrastructure\nDespite recent progress, Bihar lags behind in infrastructure development, including roads, electricity, irrigation, and market access, compared to other states. Bihar has one of the lowest road densities in the country, with only 2.6 km per square kilometer of area, compared to the national average of 3.1 km. The state has made significant improvements in rural roads through the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), which has improved connectivity in rural areas. However, the quality and maintenance of these roads remain a concern.\nElectricity is another major bottleneck in Bihar. The per capita electricity consumption in Bihar is 144 kWh, which is significantly lower than the national average of 957 kWh. The state has the lowest percentage of electrified households in the country, with only 23 percent of households having access to electricity. In rural areas, this figure drops to 15 percent, compared to the national average of 55 percent. The lack of electricity affects agricultural productivity as it limits the use of modern farming equipment and irrigation systems.\nIrrigation is critical for agriculture in Bihar, given the erratic rainfall and frequent droughts. The state has made progress in expanding irrigation coverage, with 57 percent of the gross cropped area being irrigated in TE 2013-14, compared to 48 percent in TE 2003-04. However, the dependence on diesel pumps for irrigation is high, which increases the cost of cultivation. The state has abundant groundwater resources, but the development and utilization of these resources are limited due to the high cost of diesel and the lack of electricity.\nMarket access is another area where Bihar lags behind. The state has only\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
