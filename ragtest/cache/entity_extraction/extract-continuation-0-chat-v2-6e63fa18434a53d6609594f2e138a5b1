Analysis at the district level suggests that in:\nPurnea: Acceleration in increasing growth rates at 0.77%\nWest Champaran: Acceleration at 0.25%\nDistricts such as Muzaffarpur, Saran, Sitamarhi, Vaishali, and Rohtas showed deceleration in their increasing growth rates. The declining trend rates of growth in most of the districts were, on the other hand, found to accelerate.\nii) Area under Chilli\nThe shrinkage in area under chilli was significantly large in the State. Area under chilli in the state was as high as 20.90 thousand hectares in 1970-71, which fell to 10.00 thousand hectares in 1980-81. It further slipped down to just 4.00 thousand hectares in 1987-88 and continued to hover around the same till 1991-92. In 1992-93, however, it picked up to reach 12.00 thousand hectares but remained still far below the 1970-71 level. The trend rate of growth showed a decline at (-)5.51% per annum during 1971-93. The rate of decline became more sharp (-9.49%) in the second sub-period compared to the first sub-period (-3.21%). Compared to major chilli-growing states, the area under chilli was significantly low in Bihar. It was as high as:\n224.50 thousand hectares in Andhra Pradesh\n137.93 thousand hectares in Karnataka\n128.80 thousand hectares in Maharashtra\n93.13 thousand hectares in Orissa\nwhereas it was just 7.37 thousand hectares in Bihar in 1990-93. Again, while it showed expansion in Andhra Pradesh (3.01%) and Orissa (3.35%) during 1983-93, it showed a declining trend in Karnataka (-1.14%) and Maharashtra (-1.40%). The rate of decline was high in Bihar (-4.27%) during the same period.\n \nIV.10 CHILLIES\nThe crop group of spices and condiments grown in Bihar includes turmeric, coriander, chillies, ginger, and garlic. Chillies constituted a major share in terms of both area and production among these crops in Bihar. As much as 46.8% of the spices area and 47.8% of its production were under the chilli crop in the State in 1990-93. The following paragraphs examine the trend and pattern of growth in its production as well as area and yield over the years across different agro-climatic zones and districts in the State.\ni) Production\nThere was a sharp decline in chilli production in the state over these years. It was as high as 16.50 thousand tonnes in 1970-71, reaching a peak of 24.40 thousand tonnes in 1972-73. However, it started a nosedive thereafter, with the lowest level of production at 4.0 thousand tonnes in 1987-88. It, however, took an upward movement to reach 13.00 thousand tonnes in 1992-93. The trend rate of growth recorded a decline at (-)5.12% per annum during 1971-93. The rate of decline was (-)11.99% per annum in the second sub-period compared to (-)0.18% per annum in the first sub-period. The performance of the state in chilli production was poor compared to major chilli-growing states. For example, while Andhra Pradesh had a production of chilli at 320.67 thousand tonnes, it was only 7.90 thousand tonnes in Bihar in 1990-93. States like Karnataka, Maharashtra, Orissa, and Tamil Nadu were similarly much ahead of Bihar in chilli production. In terms of growth rate, it lagged far behind. In Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, and West Bengal, chilli production increased annually at 6.65%, 3.87%, and 8.92% respectively, but in Bihar, it declined annually at (-)5.31% during 1983-93.\nRegional Pattern\nIV.10.8 Across different zones, it was the east and the north-west plains that excelled in chilli production in the state. While the east plains had a share of 41.11% in the State chilli production, it was 34.46% for the north-west plains. Across different districts:\nBegusarai in the east plains and Rohtas in the south-west plains dominated in chilli production with shares of 32.35% and 21.84% respectively.\nOther districts that produced chilli significantly included:\nEast Champaran (2.64%)\nMuzaffarpur (2.65%)\nSamastipur (6.75%)\nVaishali (3.05%) in the north-west plains\nMuhger (1.04%) and Purnea (6.05%) in the east plains\nGaya (2.52%) and Patna (8.70%) in the south-west plains\nPalamu (2.87%) in the plateau zone\nThe declining trend in chilli production was recorded in all four agro-climatic zones. However, the zones in the north Gangetic plains, i.e., north-west alluvial plains and east alluvial plains, displayed a higher rate of decline at (-)10.35% and (-)11.33% respectively compared to those in the south of the Ganges. It was (-)5.29% for the south-west alluvial plains and (-)6.32% for the plateau regions. During the first sub-period, the rate of decline was almost\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PURNEA<|>GEO<|>A district that showed acceleration in increasing growth rates at 0.77%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEST CHAMPARAN<|>GEO<|>A district that showed acceleration at 0.25%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUZAFFARPUR<|>GEO<|>A district that showed deceleration in their increasing growth rates)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SARAN<|>GEO<|>A district that showed deceleration in their increasing growth rates)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SITAMARHI<|>GEO<|>A district that showed deceleration in their increasing growth rates)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VAISHALI<|>GEO<|>A district that showed deceleration in their increasing growth rates)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROHTAS<|>GEO<|>A district that showed deceleration in their increasing growth rates and dominated in chilli production with a significant share)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>State with significant shrinkage in area under chilli, showing a decline in chilli production and area under chilli cultivation compared to other major chilli-growing states)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANDHRA PRADESH<|>GEO<|>State with the highest area under chilli cultivation and significant chilli production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KARNATAKA<|>GEO<|>State with a significant area under chilli cultivation and a declining trend in chilli production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHARASHTRA<|>GEO<|>State with a significant area under chilli cultivation and a declining trend in chilli production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORISSA<|>GEO<|>State with a significant area under chilli cultivation and an increasing trend in chilli production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEGUSARAI<|>GEO<|>District in the east plains of Bihar dominating in chilli production with a significant share)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EAST CHAMPARAN<|>GEO<|>District in the north-west plains of Bihar with significant chilli production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMASTIPUR<|>GEO<|>District in the north-west plains of Bihar with significant chilli production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAYA<|>GEO<|>District in the south-west plains of Bihar with significant chilli production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PATNA<|>GEO<|>District in the south-west plains of Bihar with significant chilli production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PALAMU<|>GEO<|>District in the plateau zone of Bihar with significant chilli production)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROHTAS<|>BIHAR<|>Rohtas is a district in Bihar that showed deceleration in growth rates and dominated in chilli production<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>ANDHRA PRADESH<|>Bihar and Andhra Pradesh are both significant in chilli cultivation but with contrasting trends in area and production<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>KARNATAKA<|>Bihar and Karnataka are compared for chilli cultivation trends, with both states showing a decline in production<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>MAHARASHTRA<|>Bihar and Maharashtra are compared for chilli cultivation trends, with both states showing a decline in production<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>ORISSA<|>Bihar and Orissa are compared for chilli cultivation, with Orissa showing an increase in production unlike Bihar<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BEGUSARAI<|>BIHAR<|>Begusarai is a district in Bihar that significantly contributes to the state's chilli production<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EAST CHAMPARAN<|>BIHAR<|>East Champaran contributes to Bihar's chilli production<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAMASTIPUR<|>BIHAR<|>Samastipur contributes to Bihar's chilli production<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GAYA<|>BIHAR<|>Gaya contributes to Bihar's chilli production<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PATNA<|>BIHAR<|>Patna contributes to Bihar's chilli production<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PALAMU<|>BIHAR<|>Palamu contributes to Bihar's chilli production<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
