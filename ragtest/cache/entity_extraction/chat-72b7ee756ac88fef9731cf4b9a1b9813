registration or certificate of manufacture or any other certificate granted under this Order to such person, the Notified Authority or registering authority or, as the case may be, the Controller may, without any notice, suspend such certificate or authorization letter as an interim measure:\nProvided that the registering authority, Notified Authority or, as the case may be, the Controller shall
