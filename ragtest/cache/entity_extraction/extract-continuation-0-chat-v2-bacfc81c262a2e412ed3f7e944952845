However, the zones in the north Gangetic plains, i.e., north-west alluvial plains and east alluvial plains, displayed a higher rate of decline at (-)10.35% and (-)11.33% respectively compared to those in the south of the Ganges. It was (-)5.29% for the south-west alluvial plains and (-)6.32% for the plateau regions. During the first sub-period, the rate of decline was almost uniform across different zones. It, however, became quite sharp in the second sub-period with respect to the north-west alluvial plains (-22.69%), east-alluvial plains (-25.43%), and plateau districts (-19.72%). The south-west alluvial plains maintained almost a similar rate of decline (-5.0%) even in the second sub-period. The east alluvial plains experienced a reversal from an increasing trend (0.81%) in the first sub-period to a high rate of decline (-25.43%) in the second sub-period.\nIV.10.5 Instability in Chilli Production\nDespite the general declining trend in chilli production, there were districts that showed an increase in production during 1977-91. Such districts were those with less share in state chilli production. They included:\nEast Champaran (5.13%)\nMuzaffarpur (5.01%)\nSaran (5.33%)\nWest Champaran (3.54%)\nAmong the dominant chilli-growing districts, only Vaishali (5.85%) showed an increasing trend. Samastipur and Begusarai, the other dominant chilli-growing districts, recorded a sharp declining trend during the same period.\nIV.10.6 Instability in Chilli Production\nThe rate of decline in chilli production was highly unstable with a coefficient of variation high at 31.60%. Across different agro-climatic zones, the rate of decline was relatively more stable in the south-west plains with a coefficient of variation at 24.98% compared to 35.00% in the north-west plains, 41.50% in the east plains, and 34.32% in the plateau districts. Analyzing the pattern across major chilli-growing districts, production in:\nMadhubani\nBegusarai\nPatna\nwas unstable, with the coefficient of variation exceeding 50.0% in all such cases. The increasing trend in Rohtas and Purnea also showed instability with high coefficients of variation. The declining trend rates of growth in most of the districts were found to accelerate.\nAnalysis of Acceleration/Deceleration\nThe declining trend in the growth rate of chilli production in the State showed deceleration (-1.62%). Across different zones:\nNorth-West: (-1.21%)\nEast: (-1.78%)\nPlateau Zone: (-1.16%)\nshowed deceleration, while the south-west plains showed acceleration (0.31%) in the declining trend rates of growth. Analysis at the district level suggests that in:\nPurnea: Acceleration in increasing growth rates at 0.77%\nWest Champaran: Acceleration at 0.25%\nDistricts such as Muzaffarpur, Saran, Sitamarhi, Vaishali, and Rohtas showed deceleration in their increasing growth rates. The declining trend rates of growth in most of the districts were, on the other hand, found to accelerate.\nii) Area under Chilli\nThe shrinkage in area under chilli was significantly large in the State. Area under chilli in the state was as high as 20.90 thousand hectares in 1970-71, which fell to 10.00 thousand hectares in 1980-81. It further slipped down to just 4.00 thousand hectares in 1987-88 and continued to hover around the same till 1991-92. In 1992-93, however, it picked up to reach 12.00 thousand hectares but remained still far below the 1970-71 level. The trend rate of growth showed a decline at (-)5.51% per annum during 1971-93. The rate of decline became sharper (-9.49%) in the second sub-period compared to the first sub-period (-3.21%). Compared to major chilli-growing states, the area under chilli was significantly low in Bihar. It was as high as:\n224.50 thousand hectares in Andhra Pradesh\n137.93 thousand hectares in Karnataka\n128.80 thousand hectares in Maharashtra\n93.13 thousand hectares in Orissa\nwhereas it was just 7.37 thousand hectares in Bihar in 1990-93. Again, while it showed expansion in Andhra Pradesh (3.01%) and Orissa (3.35%) during 1983-93, it showed a declining trend in Karnataka (-1.14%) and Maharashtra (-1.40%). The rate of decline was high in Bihar (-4.27%) during the same period.\nIV.10.9 Regional Pattern\nZones/districts with high chilli production had also high area under it. For example, the east plains with maximum production of chilli (41.11%) had maximum area under chilli as well (48.39%).
