Districts with relatively high area under gram included:\nSouth-West Plains: Bhojpur (11.79%), Patna (10.23%), and Rohtas (13.35%)\nPlateau: Palamu (7.39%) and Santhal Parganas (3.14%)\nEast: Munger (9.59%) and Bhagalpur (6.60%)\nNorth-West Plains: Darbhanga (2.36%), Saran (1.60%), and Siwan (1.45%)\nIV.5.9 Trend Growth Rates in Area\nFurther, shrinkage in area under gram was observed in all the four agro-climatic zones, however, varying from a high rate of decline at (-4.40%) in the north-west alluvial plains to a low of (-1.51%) in the south-west alluvial plains. The zone of plateau districts showed equally high levels of shrinkage at (-3.91%) during this period. East alluvial plains, on the other hand, showed a modest rate of shrinkage at (-2.43%). Between the two sub-periods, the second sub-period witnessed a slackened rate of decline in the north-west and plateau zone. In the case of the east plains, the rate of decline accelerated in the second sub-period to (-10.53%). The south-west plains, however, experienced a reversal from a declining trend in the first sub-period to an increasing trend in the second sub-period. Across different districts, the rate of growth in gram area was positive in select districts only, viz:\nNalanda (0.10%)\nNawadah (1.17%)\nGiridih (0.65%)\nThese were the districts with less dominance in its production. Districts with dominant gram production showed shrinkage in their area.\nIV.5.10 Yield of Gram\nThere has been a definite increase in the yield of gram over these years in Bihar. It was 0.71 thousand tonnes/ha in 1970-71, which declined initially to reach the lowest level at 0.44 thousand tonnes/ha in 1973-74 but showed an increasing trend thereafter, reaching the maximum level of 1.02 tonnes/ha in 1991-92 with an index number reaching 143 points. The trend rate of growth during 1971-93 thus showed an increase at 2.14% per annum. Analysis of the trend rates of growth in two sub-periods suggests that although it showed an increasing trend in both periods, the rate of increase was higher during the second sub-period (1.35%) than the first sub-period (0.48%).\nIV.5.11 Comparative Yield\nComparing the yield level across major gram growing states, it is encouraging to observe that Bihar figured at the top with a yield level of 0.91 tonnes/ha during 1990-93 as against 0.87 tonnes/ha in Uttar Pradesh, 0.61 tonnes/ha in Rajasthan, 0.50 tonnes/ha in Maharashtra, 0.76 tonnes/ha in Madhya Pradesh, and 0.68 tonnes/ha in Haryana. In terms of growth as well, it showed an encouraging picture for Bihar. It grew annually at 2.22% in Bihar, 1.57% in Madhya Pradesh, and 0.59% in Uttar Pradesh during 1983-93. In Rajasthan, it showed a declining trend at (-1.36%). However, Maharashtra and Haryana showed better performance with yield levels growing annually at around 3.30% during the same period.\nIV.5.12 Yield by Zone and District\nAcross different zones, the south-west plains with high production of gram also showed a high yield level of gram at 0.98 t/ha. The zone of plateau districts had the least yield at 0.83 t/ha. Further, districts showing high levels of gram production also showed high levels of yield of gram. They included:\nSouth-West: Patna (1.25 t/ha.) and Bhojpur (1.04 t/ha.)\nNorth-West: Siwan (1.02 t/ha.)\nEast: Begusarai (0.95 t/ha.)\nPlateau: Santhal Parganas (0.77 t/ha.) and Palamu (0.74 t/ha.)\nIV.5 Gram\nIV.5.1 Production\nThe production of gram has been consistently declining in the state over the years. It was as high as 174.20 thousand tonnes in 1970-71, which declined to 123.90 thousand tonnes in 1981-82. It, however, recorded an upward movement in subsequent years but never reached the base level of 1970-71. During the eighties, the annual production of gram hovered around 140 to 160 thousand tonnes. The index number came down to its lowest at 56 in 1992-93. The trend rate of growth for the period 1971-93 showed a declining trend at (-0.25%). It showed a declining trend in both sub-periods. It was more sharp at (-2.09%) per annum during the first sub-period. The declining trend narrowed in the second sub-period at (-1.05%) per annum, due to wider application of HYV seeds/pesticides technology in particular. Bihar occupied sixth position in its production (135.7 thousand tonnes in 1990-93) with states such as Madhya Pradesh (1778.13 thousand tonnes), Uttar Pradesh (994.77 thousand tonnes),\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
