Therefore, in order to fully exploit the potential, there would be a need for much higher financial resources.\n238. Although Bihar has established a good network for dairy, the health of animals continues to be poor and there is a lot of potential for improvements in animal health and thus scope for addition in animal products and value addition in milk. Similarly, huge water bodies are not appropriately utilized. The report aims to enhance the health of animals, improve the average milk productivity, establish poultry especially backyard poultry, and promote goatery, piggery, and duckiery. Intervention is expected to make livestock production economical – leading to sustainable reward to millions of vulnerable farmers. Further, production of fish is also expected to double in five years in light of the proposed strategy.\n239. Implementation of the proposed strategy is expected to create employment of 45,000 million mandays besides making the state produce surplus food to meet the growing demand of the nation, as the state has rich land and water resources. This would empower the people and reverse the trend of going out of state for employment. Resultantly, there shall be parity, equality, and inclusive growth. This would also help the nation from emerging food insecurity.\n240. Particular focus has been placed on human resource development with substantially enlarged financial outlays. It is believed that quality human resource at all levels shall be the key to the success of programmes of development. Skill upgradation of officers, extension functionaries, and farmers would be required having institutional arrangements. The trainers will also need training in new areas of innovations to ensure upgraded skill developments.\n241. All these would require considerable efforts on monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of various development projects under the proposed strategies and policy direction. Since the proposals are based on ground reality evaluation, which has come out after detailed deliberation with all the stakeholders, there would be a need for developing implementable projects with a time frame, integrating all the efforts together in a ‘Mission Mode’ to address all the issues identified. Since the state has poor infrastructure for delivery, it would also need strengthening. Therefore, with mission objectives, an empowered apex organization should be created which shall oversee the development, provide guidance and ensure effective implementation of the programme. The programme shall have mid-term appraisal for its impact and mid-course correction.\nChapter 12: Conclusions\n242. Bihar agriculture has the potential to grow rapidly so as to meet the existing shortages and assume primacy in the national agricultural economy. The State has immense agricultural resources, to facilitate a Second Green Revolution in the Country. Bihar must aim at an annual agricultural rate of 5-6%. However, despite the strength of the agriculture sector, it is a paradox that this sector is growing at a snail’s pace. The rate of growth has been below its potential. There has been a conspicuous failure to exploit those resources to the desired level. This study has endeavoured to identify the factors behind the dismal performance of the sector.\n243. A micro-level analysis of the data shows that there are wide productivity differences among different regions in the State. From among the crop sector, yields of maize, gram, and sunflower are higher than the all-India average. But the area under all these crops is very small. The country at present suffers from a severe shortage of pulses and oils. Because of the development of poultry, demand for maize is also rising fast. The study has found that due to an appreciable increase in the irrigated area, there is a likelihood of an increase of over 2 million hectares in the gross cropped area. If so, a major chunk of this area should be allocated to these crops to meet the national requirements and help bring sustained food security of the country.\n244. Productivity levels in Bihar compared with other States and the all-India average show huge gaps. The low productivity of major crops is to be examined in the light of poor infrastructure and institutional framework. Add to that various agronomic factors like poor quality of seed, unbalanced and inadequate use of fertilizers, practically no use of micro-nutrients, little knowledge of pest management, lack of proper machinery, and finally poor extension services. The results are obvious.\n245. Available data reveals that the country is going to face the challenges of food security in the light of decreasing food production over the last decade. The current overall growth rate of farm production at the level of 2.5-2.0% due to shrinkage in cultivable area and changing global climate, the national and global food stock is expected to be at a comparatively lower level. Fortunately, Bihar is uniquely placed to fill in the gap and provide the major granary for India, if proper strategic and policy directions are set for enhanced farm production. The Road Map in this Report provides this.\n246. It needs to be clearly borne in mind that business as usual will not yield the desired result in terms of achieving accelerated agriculture growth in Bihar. If Bihar has to be put on the mainstream of India’s development map, concerted efforts will have to be made on a war footing. There is a need for an in-depth study of the factors responsible for low productivity levels in the concerned regions which will provide the key to improving production. Applying new technology - Zero Till, Bed Planting for wheat, System for Rice Intensification (SRI) Technique for rice, Site-Specific Nutrient Management for rice and wheat, and hybrids for maize, encouraging results have been achieved within Bihar itself on farmers’ fields. These need to be developed at a larger scale for making Bihar the ‘Granary’ of India and help India in maintaining food security.\n247. Taking care of these factors along with other local issues as discussed, the emerging production scenario for 2011-12 has been projected (Annexure XXXVII & Annexure XXXVIII). It gives an additional production of 2\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India with potential for significant agricultural growth, facing challenges in farm productivity and infrastructure)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SECOND GREEN REVOLUTION<|>EVENT<|>A proposed agricultural revolution in Bihar aimed at significantly increasing agricultural productivity and meeting national food security needs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MISSION MODE<|>EVENT<|>A strategic approach for implementing various development projects in Bihar with an emphasis on integration and time-bound execution)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Refers to the natural and economic resources in Bihar available for agriculture, including land, water, and crop diversity)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>SECOND GREEN REVOLUTION<|>Bihar is identified as the potential site for the Second Green Revolution to boost its agricultural sector<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>MISSION MODE<|>Bihar needs to adopt a 'Mission Mode' strategy to effectively implement development projects and improve its agricultural and infrastructural sectors<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SECOND GREEN REVOLUTION<|>AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES<|>The Second Green Revolution in Bihar aims to utilize the state's agricultural resources to their full potential<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
