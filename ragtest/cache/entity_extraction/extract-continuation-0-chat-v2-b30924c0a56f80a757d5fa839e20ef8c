Agriculture's share of total power sales has decreased from 13.1% in 2009-10 to 6.1% in 2012-13, reflecting poor infrastructure and low electricity usage in agriculture, with only 62 kWh/ha, compared to over 1,000 kWh/ha in more advanced states. The state relies heavily on diesel for irrigation, driving up costs and reducing profitability. Recent initiatives under the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana and solar pumping programs aim to improve power supply to agriculture, but challenges remain, especially in integrating surplus power back into the grid.\n\n5.1.4 Roads\nRural roads are crucial for agricultural development, reducing transportation costs, and improving market access. Although Bihar's road density is slightly above the national average, only 47.2% of roads are surfaced, compared to much higher percentages in Gujarat, Punjab, and other states. Improving surfaced road density is essential for enhancing the state's agricultural infrastructure.\n\n5.1.5 Procurement System\nBihar's farmers face significant challenges due to inadequate marketing infrastructure, limiting their ability to benefit from the minimum support prices (MSP) provided by the government. The Food Corporation of India's procurement from Bihar is low compared to states like Punjab and Haryana, with only 19.4% of rice and 9.0% of wheat production procured. This low procurement affects farm harvest prices, which often remain below the MSP.\n\nThese sections highlight the critical issues and ongoing efforts in Bihar to address the challenges posed by natural disasters, energy deficiencies, poor infrastructure, and limited market access for farmers.\n\nAgriculture Marketing and Storage\n\nThe farm harvest price (FHP) of rice and wheat has been significantly lower than the MSP consistently over a long period for both wheat and paddy. It is a matter of concern that the deviation between the FHP and MSP for both paddy and wheat has increased in recent years. The average price difference between the MSP and FHP for the period 2008-09 to 2013-14 for paddy was 22.6 percent and for wheat, 10.2 percent (Figure 24). The low procurement ratio in the state is primarily due to the absence of infrastructure for marketing and, in particular, the lack of storage facilities, which the state is now endeavoring to build.\n\n\nAgriculture Marketing in Bihar\n\nBihar took the unique step of repealing the APMC Act in 2006, and at present, there is no legislation regulating agricultural marketing. It was learnt informally from government sources that a new legislation to replace the repealed APMC Act is not under consideration by the state government. Instead, the government is setting up administrative structures to ensure the smooth functioning of markets. There will be an administrator with the rank of district magistrate assisted by a team of officials to oversee the functioning of markets, which have arrangements for food grains, fruits and vegetables, fish, etc.\n\nKishore, Sharma, and Joshi (2014) highlight that the post-APMC era in Bihar seems to have been a mixed experience for different stakeholders. For farmers, the liberalized regime seems to have been similar to the APMC days. They continue to sell their produce to village aggregators, who take the collected produce to the nearby mandis, keeping farmers isolated from the institutional changes being effected in markets, at least in the short run.\n\nOn the other hand, the liberal market environment favors processing industries as they now have increased sourcing options without paying mandi taxes. However, the food processing industry is at a very nascent stage in Bihar, and therefore these benefits are limited. At the national level, only 2 to 3 percent of total fruits and vegetables go through any kind of processing activity. However, for Bihar, food processing is much more important as the high-value segment dominates the agricultural output. Bihar produces around 10 percent of total vegetables in the country and around 5 percent of fruits, yet only 4 percent of total cold storages in India are in Bihar. Of the total 304 cold storages in Bihar, more than 75 percent were exclusively used for potatoes. Worse, a substantial number of cold storages have shut down in the recent past because they have become unviable. The assessment is that cold storages can become viable only if they have multi-product capability. The shortcomings in the quality and quantity of power supply in the state have also contributed to the closure of cold storages.\n\nTo bolster cold storage construction, the Bihar Government has initiated a cold storage scheme under which cold storages with a capacity of 5 to 10 thousand tonnes can avail of a subsidy of 30 percent on capital expenditure. For a capacity of more than 10 thousand tonnes, the subsidy can be availed of to the extent of 35 percent. The maximum amount of subsidy is limited to Rs. 5 crore. Cultivation of fruits and vegetables is a risky activity due to high post-harvest losses because of their short shelf life. In order to minimize post-harvest losses, cold storages play an important role. According to a study, post-harvest losses in fruits and vegetables vary from 15-50 percent in Bihar (IL&FS, 2007).\n\nFurther, Bihar has ambitious plans to expand storage of food grains, the lack of capacity in which has been identified as one of the main impediments in increasing procurement. The estimated capacity needed is 12.61 lakh metric tonnes, against which 6.98 lakh metric tonnes was in existence at the beginning of the year 2016-17. The plan is to make good the shortfall of 5.63 lakh metric tonnes during 2016-17 and to add a further capacity of 60,000 metric tonnes every year up to 202\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India facing challenges in agriculture, energy, infrastructure, and market access for farmers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEEN DAYAL UPADHYAYA GRAM JYOTI YOJANA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A government initiative aimed at improving power supply to agriculture in Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FOOD CORPORATION OF INDIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Responsible for the procurement of rice and wheat in Bihar, with low procurement rates compared to other states)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APMC ACT<|>EVENT<|>Legislation regulating agricultural marketing in India, repealed in Bihar in 2006)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IL&FS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Conducted a study on post-harvest losses in fruits and vegetables in Bihar)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEEN DAYAL UPADHYAYA GRAM JYOTI YOJANA<|>BIHAR<|>This initiative is aimed at improving Bihar's agricultural power supply<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FOOD CORPORATION OF INDIA<|>BIHAR<|>Operates within Bihar to procure rice and wheat, affecting farm harvest prices<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APMC ACT<|>BIHAR<|>Its repeal in 2006 affected agricultural marketing and infrastructure in Bihar<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IL&FS<|>BIHAR<|>Conducted research on post-harvest losses, highlighting challenges in Bihar's agricultural sector<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
