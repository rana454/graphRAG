The COE will facilitate:\n   * Development of new varieties of millets as per the agro-climatic situation of the state.\n   * Post-production marketing and value addition of millets as per market demands.\n* Suitable seeds of jute and millets will be provided to the farmers to promote crop diversification.\n* Cultivation of aromatic and medicinal plants (e.g., Lemongrass, Palma-rosa, Tulsi, Satawari) with micro-irrigation and distillation unit facilities will be promoted in the barren and uncultivated lands of South Bihar.\n* Cultivation of dryland horticulture crops (e.g., Indian gooseberry (Amla), Wood apple, Jackfruits) will be promoted.\n* Khus cultivation will be promoted in the Diara areas of Budhi Gandak and Kosi river of North Bihar.\nFourth Agriculture Roadmap 2023-28\nIntroduction:\nPlant protection plays an important role in modern technology-based crop production. In India, about 30-35% of crops are lost every year due to pests and weeds. By strengthening plant protection and adopting measures to effectively control pests, diseases, and weeds, the percentage of crop damage caused by these factors can be reduced. The lack of modern spraying and dispersion equipment at plant protection centers has led to a decline in the plant protection services provided to farmers. There is a need to increase manpower at the Plant Protection Centers to rejuvenate these services. After the Green Revolution, the dependence of farmers on chemical pesticides has increased. Pesticides are not used in scientifically recommended doses by farmers, leading to adverse effects on the environment and human health.\nBrief Achievements of the Last Three Agricultural Roadmaps:\nField schools based on the principle of learning by doing and seeing were organized in the farmers’ fields during Kharif and Rabi seasons. The theme of the farmers' training in these field schools was based on integrated pest management. There is a need to increase the number of farmers' field schools.\nPriorities for Plant Protection:\n1. Operationalization of Plant Protection Centers at Block Level in PPP Mode\n   * The identified service provider agency shall arrange necessary spraying equipment, such as rocker sprayers, knapsack sprayers, duster cum sprayers, power sprayers, multiboom sprayers, and STP power sprayer/dusters, along with adequate security equipment for spraying at plant protection centers and skilled personnel for spraying.\n   * Payment received by the service agency from the farmers will be shared between the service agency and the government in a proportion of 80:20 respectively.\n   * Currently, only 338 Plant Protection Centers are located in E-Kisan Bhawan. In the remaining blocks, 196 Plant Protection Centers will be set up in the next 5 years.\n   * Stationary materials and furniture will be provided to Plant Protection Centers in 534 blocks in a phased manner over the next 5 years for operationalization of these centers in PPP mode. Provision has been made for recurring expenditure on this component.\n2. Encouragement to Private Entrepreneurs for Setting Up Biopesticide Production Units\n   * In Bihar, bio-agents/biopesticides are produced in negligible quantities, leading to reliance on externally produced biopesticides. This affects the availability of quality inputs to farmers.\n   * Ten biopesticide production units will be set up by private entrepreneurs in a phased manner over the next five years for the supply of Trichoderma and Trichograma cards. Land for these units will be arranged by the entrepreneurs themselves, with 20% of the total cost borne by the entrepreneur and 80% as a subsidy from the department. Provision has been made for recurring expenditure every year.\n3. Use of Unmanned Vehicles (Drones) for Plant Protection\n   * A service provider agency will be identified for the operation of unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) across all 38 districts.\n   * 5,70,000 acres of land will be covered under this initiative in the next 5 years. Spraying services will be made available to farmers through drone technology, with government assistance at the rate of Rs. 250 per acre. Provision has been made for recurring expenditure every year.\n4. Plant Protection Advisory & Input Distribution\n   * Plant Protection School: Plant protection schools will be organized on the fields of progressive farmers to propagate the latest techniques in agriculture. Information related to field preparation, crop management, and pest/disease/weed control will be provided by plant protection workers, agricultural experts, and extension workers. This school will follow the principle of learning by doing and seeing.\n   * Demonstration of Biological Components of Plant Protection in Farmers' Fields: Live demonstrations of biological components of plant protection will be conducted at farmers' fields to encourage the use of bio-agents and biopesticides. This will promote organic farming and enhance export quality and market prices for major crops such as mango, litchi, makhana, and basmati rice. Provision has been made for recurring expenditure every year.\n   * Capacity Building of Extension Personnel: Agricultural personnel will be trained in the latest plant protection techniques by Plant Protection Centers, augmenting the capacity of the Agriculture Department’s personnel.\n   * Capacity Building of Pesticide Dealers: Pesticide dealers, who are often the first point of contact for farmers, will receive training to increase their capacity. Training programs will be organized in batches of 25 dealers per district.\n   * Providing Organic/Chemical Inputs to Farmers at Subsidized Rates:\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
