These need to be developed at a larger scale for making Bihar the ‘Granary’ of India and help India in maintaining food security.\n247. Taking care of these factors along with other local issues as discussed, the emerging production scenario for 2011-12 has been projected (Annexure XXXVII & Annexure XXXVIII). It gives an additional production of 2 million tonnes each of rice and wheat, 3.4 million tonnes of maize, over 4 lakh tonnes of gram, and over a million tonnes of oilseeds along with 9 million tonnes of sugarcane. The Government of India has a target of 10 million tonnes of rice, 8 million tonnes of wheat, and 2 million tonnes of pulses under the XI Plan (National Food Security Fund). The Government of Bihar should take full advantage of the funds allocated under the Scheme for ensuring high-quality seed, fertilizer, and large-scale demonstration, etc., and can thus become a major partner in this programme.\n248. The agro-climatic diversity in the State with its high rainfall distributed over a five-month monsoon and a reasonably long and moderate winter allows for a variety of horticultural crops to be grown. An analysis of horticulture production in Bihar reveals that potential for significant increase in horticulture production requires investments in all spheres – from institutional to crop management practices. Animal Husbandry and Dairy are the subsidiary income-generating activities for the rural poor of Bihar. Therefore, the progress in this sector will result in more balanced development in the rural economy. The main strategy should be to increase livestock production through controlled breeding programmes, strengthen infrastructural facilities, and ensure animal health cover.\n249. Soil conservation practices are very important for Bihar which is ridden with floods and drought. The prime focus of organic agriculture is the management of soil organic matter to enhance the chemical, physical, and biological properties of soil. The concept of feeding the soils rather than the plants forms the basis of the sustainable approach for organic farming in the State.\n250. Agriculture is the single largest private sector occupation in the State and can be considered the riskiest business. Increasing income of the land-owning and landless rural population through increased production by enhancing productivity and intensity of farming, and by generating more employment in agriculture and other rural-based production activities alone is not the solution, and there is a need to integrate these endeavours with effective risk management strategies to cover potential losses in yield and hence incomes. This Report covers this aspect.\n251. The most important lesson for Bihar is to capitalize on strength and convert weakness into opportunity through the creation of infrastructure, adoption of technologies, strengthening of research, agricultural education, market orientation, and agricultural enterprises. Success story of other states could also be tried as a mode. The crux of the matter is that Bihar has the potentialities of being the forerunner of the Second Green Revolution. But the policy of ‘business as usual’ will not do. The state has to make efforts on a war footing, intensify their activity, and implement the programmes at the ground level. The proper exploitation of opportunities in Bihar would be the opportunity for India to emerge as the economically sound nation in the world. This will be based on a dynamic agriculture sector.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
