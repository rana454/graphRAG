The growth rate during 1983-93 was 4.34%, higher than the national average of 3.70%.\nRegional Pattern\nNorth-west Plains: 40.93% share of total wheat production\nSouth-west Plains: 35.41% share\nEast Plains: 21.61% share\nPlateau Zone: 2.05% share\nProminent wheat-producing districts include:\nNorth-west: East Champaran, Gopalganj, Saran, Siwan, West Champaran\nEast Plains: Begusarai, Purnea, Saharsa\nSouth-west Plains: Rohtas, Bhojpur\nTable IV.3.5: Growth Trend in Wheat Production (1977-91)\nThe growth rate improved significantly in the second sub-period, with the north-west and south-west alluvial plains showing rates exceeding 6.0%. The plateau region reversed its declining trend with a growth rate of 2.67%.\nInstability in Wheat Production\nThe coefficient of variation in wheat production was 8.81% overall. It was lower in the north-west (8.34%) and south-west (9.35%) but higher in the plateau zone (16.28%). Districts with high instability included Gopalganj, Samastipur, Sitamarhi, Katihar, and Dhanbad.\nTable IV.3.8: Acceleration/Deceleration in Wheat Production\nii) Area under Wheat\nTable IV.3.10: Area Under Wheat (1960-61 to 1992-93)\nThe area under wheat increased from 6.39 lakh hectares in 1960-61 to 19.96 lakh hectares in 1992-93, with a CAGR of 3.59%. The growth rate slowed in the second sub-period to 1.34% from 2.22% in the first sub-period. Bihar's area expansion compares favorably with states like Assam, Gujarat, and Maharashtra, which experienced declines during the 1980s.\n\nIV.2 Maize\nIV.2.1 Yield of Maize\nThe yield of maize in the state showed a significant increase over the years, offsetting the resultant impact of the decline in area on output levels of maize. The yield of maize was 1120 kg/ha in 1970-71, which increased to 1830 kg/ha in 1992-93, registering a compound annual rate of growth of 3.50% during 1971-93. Much of the yield increase was recorded during the second sub-period with a growth rate of 5.15% compared to 2.25% in the first sub-period. The yield level of maize in the state compared well with the national average of 1530 kg/ha but was less compared to states like Karnataka (2960 kg/ha), West Bengal (2260 kg/ha), and Punjab (2020 kg/ha).\nIV.2.2 Regional Pattern\nAcross different zones, the average yield of maize was much higher in the north-west (1.88 t/ha), followed by the east plains (1.64 t/ha). In the south-west, although the area under maize was relatively much less, the yield was fairly high at 1.42 t/ha. The plateau districts lagged far behind with a yield of maize at 0.97 t/ha only. Across districts, it was highest at 2.47 t/ha in Samastipur. In Begusarai and Saharsa, although production of maize and its area was relatively high, they lagged far behind other districts of the north-west in terms of yield. It was 1.98 t/ha in Begusarai and 1.87 t/ha in Saharsa, compared to 2.34 t/ha in Darbhanga, 2.27 t/ha in Madhubani, 2.13 t/ha in East Champaran, and 2.12 t/ha in Muzaffarpur.\nIV.2.3 Trend Growth in Yield\nAnalysis of trend growth in yield showed that the north-west alluvial plains registered the highest growth rate of 4.36% per annum during 1977-91. It was followed by the east alluvial plains with a growth rate of 3.80% and the south-west alluvial plains at 2.43%. The plateau districts showed a growth in yield at 1.94% during this period. Increase in yield showed acceleration in all the zones during the second sub-period; however, more in respect of the east alluvial plains (6.37%). The rate of growth in yield was relatively high in major maize-growing districts such as Begusarai (8.03%) and Saharsa (10.58%) during the second sub-period.\nIV.2.4 Conclusions\nThe following broad conclusions may thus be arrived at:\nProduction Trends: Production of maize in Bihar remained stagnant till 1987-88 with marginal year-to-year fluctuation. The subsequent period, however, witnessed acceleration in maize production in the state. It was only next to Uttar Pradesh in the volume of maize production. In terms of rate of growth, however, it lagged behind states like Karnataka,\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MAIZE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Maize production in Bihar has seen a significant increase in yield over the years despite a decline in area, with notable growth rates and comparisons with national averages and other states)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHEAT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Wheat production in Bihar has grown substantially from 1958 to 1993, with a detailed analysis of regional patterns, growth trends, and instability in production across different districts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>State in India experiencing notable trends in maize and wheat production, with comparisons to other states and detailed analysis of agricultural patterns)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORTH-WEST PLAINS<|>GEO<|>Region in Bihar with a significant share of total wheat production and high yield of maize)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTH-WEST PLAINS<|>GEO<|>Region in Bihar experiencing the highest rate of decline in maize area but still contributing substantially to wheat production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EAST PLAINS<|>GEO<|>Region in Bihar with a notable share of wheat production and high maize yield)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLATEAU ZONE<|>GEO<|>Region in Bihar with the lowest share of wheat production and lowest maize yield, but showing growth in yield over time)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMASTIPUR<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with the highest maize yield among the regions analyzed)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEGUSARAI<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar known for its maize production but lagging in yield compared to other north-west districts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAHARSA<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with significant maize production and area but lower yield compared to other major maize-growing districts)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAIZE<|>BIHAR<|>Maize production trends in Bihar show significant yield increases over time despite area decline<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WHEAT<|>BIHAR<|>Wheat production in Bihar has seen substantial growth and regional distribution across the state<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NORTH-WEST PLAINS<|>WHEAT<|>North-west Plains have a significant share of Bihar's total wheat production<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOUTH-WEST PLAINS<|>MAIZE<|>South-west Plains experienced the highest rate of decline in maize area<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EAST PLAINS<|>MAIZE<|>East Plains have a high yield of maize compared to other regions<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLATEAU ZONE<|>MAIZE<|>Plateau Zone shows growth in maize yield over time despite having the lowest yield<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAMASTIPUR<|>MAIZE<|>Samastipur has the highest maize yield among the districts analyzed<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BEGUSARAI<|>MAIZE<|>Begusarai's maize production is significant but has a lower yield compared to Samastipur<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAHARSA<|>MAIZE<|>Saharsa, despite its significant maize production and area, lags in yield<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
