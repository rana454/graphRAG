Data Gathering and Development Planning\nTimely, complete, and reliable statistics on potential resources, status of utilization, resource-wise and species-wise production and productivity levels, catch and fishing effort, different socio-economic parameters, and market information is essential for formulation of relevant policies, programs, and action plans. At present, there is no established and foolproof system for systematic and regular collection of data on fisheries in the State. Only crude estimations and approximations with wide margins of error form the basis of development planning and management.\nThe policy envisages institutionalizing a mechanism for systematic collection, verification, and updating of timely, complete, and reliable statistics on various physical, biological, economic, and social parameters of fisheries as per the nationally and internationally agreed format. Involvement of various stakeholders particularly the producer groups will be strongly encouraged in both collection and verification of various statistics. Measures are to be initiated for proper categorization, analysis, and wider dissemination of data thus generated and maintaining a computerized database for easy retrieval. Remote sensing and Geographical Information System would be deployed for survey of various resources especially the open water bodies to be followed by ground truthing.\n\n3. Development of Aquaculture in Ponds\nTanks and ponds of water spread area less than 10 ha in sizes that can be classified as ponds total an area of about 65,000 ha. Of these, about 22,000 ha are constituted by individual ponds of sizes less than 0.5 ha while about 26,500 number of water bodies with water spread area between 0.5 and 10 ha constitute a cumulative water spread area of 43,000 ha. Presently, aquaculture in ponds and tanks remains the main support for the livelihood of the poor fish farmers in rural areas. However, the productivity of ponds is only about 800 kg/ha which is much below their potential of 3000-5000 kg/ha/year.\nFragmented and small size of land holdings due to higher growth rate of population, heavy siltation and poor physical condition of ponds, and traditional culture practices have made the pond aquaculture remain as a subsistence activity. The policy proposes to bring aquaculture at par with agriculture in terms of credit, taxation, energy charges, water tariff, and land allocation owing to the similarities between the two sectors in the resource use pattern, providing livelihood support to fishing and farming households and further fisheries development in the State. The policy envisages that all types of water bodies below 10 ha in size shall be brought under improved scientific composite fish culture and achieve an annual average productivity of 3000-5000 kg/ha. This is to be made possible by restoration and renovation of existing water bodies, creation of new water bodies, imparting training on appropriate technologies, extension support and ensuring availability of all inputs and support services including credit facilities. Also, support under various schemes is to be mobilized for renovation of the Government ponds.\n\n4. Development of Fisheries in Ox-Bow Lakes\nAn estimated 9,000 ha of water spread area varying in size from 4 to 400 ha in the form of ox-bow lakes or mauns offers immense scope for scientific culture-based fisheries development supporting a sizeable number of fishers and small and marginal farming households. These lakes are the discarded loops of meandering rivers, mainly in the Gandak basin, which gets disconnected and connected with the main rivers during floods or rainy season thereby drawing water. At present, mainly capture fisheries is practiced, and only about 2700 ha area i.e. less than one-third of available area has been brought under culture with an average productivity of 300-400 kg/ha/yr. The lakes have been subjected to a number of stress factors like heavy infestation of aquatic weeds, siltation, encroachment, habitat degradation, etc., leading to considerable decline in its physical expanse and aquatic biodiversity.\nThe policy seeks to bring almost every ox-bow lake under improved culture fisheries and achieve an annual average productivity of 1000-2000 kg/ha by introducing modern technologies, extension support, input and credit facilities, conservation measures, and protection measures against encroachment and degradation. Also, research support on breeding, seed production, and culture practices in ox-bow lakes will be sought. Water resources and ecological parameters of the lakes will be monitored regularly and maintained. Lake users will be organized into co-operatives to manage, develop, and protect the water bodies and other common resources collectively.\n\n5. Development of Flood Plain Wetlands\nFlood plains and wetlands locally known as chaurs, are extensive and support major fisheries resources of the State, particularly in North Bihar. These areas have an estimated water spread of about 45,978 ha which have been estimated to be several times higher by the Irrigation Department. At present, only about 27% of the total area has been brought under culture fisheries with an average productivity of 300-500 kg/ha/year. The remaining areas support extensive capture fisheries as well as unscientific aquaculture.\nThe policy envisages scientific development of all flood plain wetlands for culture fisheries and aims to achieve an annual average productivity of 1000-2000 kg/ha/year. The strategy includes scientific and efficient utilization of flood plain wetlands, improving and upgrading\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DIRECTORATE OF FISHERIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Agency proposed to be transformed into a professional entity providing extension services to fishers, farmers, and entrepreneurs with a people-centered approach)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AQUACULTURE<|>EVENT<|>Development of aquaculture in ponds and tanks to support livelihood of poor fish farmers, with a goal to increase productivity through scientific methods)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OX-BOW LAKES<|>GEO<|>Water bodies in the Gandak basin, targeted for improved culture fisheries development to support fishers and farming households)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLOOD PLAIN WETLANDS<|>GEO<|>Extensive areas in North Bihar, planned for scientific development to enhance culture fisheries productivity)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DIRECTORATE OF FISHERIES<|>AQUACULTURE<|>The Directorate of Fisheries is responsible for promoting and implementing aquaculture development policies<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AQUACULTURE<|>OX-BOW LAKES<|>Aquaculture development includes improving productivity in ox-bow lakes<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AQUACULTURE<|>FLOOD PLAIN WETLANDS<|>Aquaculture development strategies aim to enhance productivity in flood plain wetlands<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OX-BOW LAKES<|>FLOOD PLAIN WETLANDS<|>Both ox-bow lakes and flood plain wetlands are targeted for fisheries development under the same policy<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
