Bee-Keeping\nShri Radhakant Giri is a highly successful farmer who, through hard work and determination, has achieved a good livelihood and helped other farmers become self-reliant. He hails from the small village of Bhat Boreya, Block-Burmu, Dist-Ranchi. Initially struggling with poor economic conditions, he left his studies after intermediate and started a business. Shri Giri decided to focus on honey production and faced challenges with initial low production due to Indian bees and lack of knowledge. He then enrolled in a 45-day motivational course at Ramakrishna Mission Ashrama, Divyayan Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Ranchi, in 1997. After completing special training in honey bee keeping, he started his business with two boxes of Italian bees. Despite facing many problems, the emotional support from his family helped him persevere. Today, Shri Giri effectively runs his business with 55 boxes of honey bees and supplies high-quality honey to reputed companies like Dabur and Kashmir Apiary. He also engages in the production of cereals, vegetables, fruits, and milk scientifically. Shri Giri completed a master training course from the Central Bee Research Training Centre, Pune, in February 2012. He has been honored by the former President of India, Her Excellency Dr. (Mrs.) Pratibha Patil, in November 2007.\n2. Borax: Boon for Cauliflower Growers in East Singhbhum\nIn East Singhbhum district, cauliflower is grown as a mid and late-season crop. The soil in the district is 77% acidic, with a pH varying from 4.1 to 7.3. Cauliflower acts as an indicator plant for boron deficiency, which appears first in its vegetative parts like browning of curd and hollowness in the stem. Continuous and intensive cultivation of vegetables in the same field also contributes to boron deficiency, leading to rotting and browning of curd heads up to 70-80%. Since the establishment of KVK, East Singhbhum, scientists observed that farmers used to spray pesticides and other chemicals or growth hormones to address this problem, but these attempts failed. An OFT conducted in 10 farmers' fields during 2006-07 showed satisfactory results with the application of borax in spray at 15 kg/ha (yield 203.20 q/ha and 10% rotting) compared to soil application of borax at 10 kg/ha (yield 194.20 q/ha and 15% rotting) and control (yield 153.20 q/ha and 40% rotting). The efficiency of borax was further verified through Front Line Demonstrations in Patamda, Jamshedpur, Ghatsila, Dhalbhumgarh, and Potka blocks during 2008 and 2012. Results indicated increased production and productivity due to decreased browning and rotting of cauliflower heads. Field days (5 nos) were organized for wider dissemination, and farmers were convinced of the effectiveness of spraying borax at 15 kg/ha twice—first after 20-25 DAT and second 40-45 DAT. Through FLD, 115 farmers from different blocks of East Singhbhum district are now practicing borax application in their cauliflower fields with negligible browning and rotting. The curd color and firmness were also better. On average, a yield of 375 q/ha (var. Barkha) was observed in borax-sprayed fields compared to 195 q/ha in control fields. The net return was around Rs. 1,12,500 per ha, with a benefit-cost ratio of 2.50. Other farmers in nearby villages and blocks are also adopting this practice, and as borax is readily available in the local market, farmers face no difficulty in procurement.\n3. Sri Ramdeep Singh\nSri Ramdeep Singh, son of Late Chattar Singh, from village Ranbigha, P.O. Uttrain, Block-Konch, district Gaya, is a progressive farmer with 5.0 acres of land. Initially managing his livelihood through traditional cultivation methods, he sought improved agricultural techniques from KVK scientists to enhance production and income. He was initially reluctant to adopt diversified agriculture but eventually established a guava orchard on 2.0 acres of land, earning approximately Rs. 1.8 lakh annually. He also intercrops turmeric, ginger, and elephant foot yam, and produces paddy and wheat on another 2.0 acres of land, earning Rs. 80,000 annually. Under diversified training, he also grows flowers (marigold, Rajanigandha, gladiolus), spirulina, organic vegetables, onions, potatoes, and sugarcane, generating additional income.
