Fruits account for just 3 percent, while protein-rich foods, like meat, fish, and eggs, make up 15 percent of the total expenditure on food in any given month.\nAlthough the food expenditures described here reflect redistribution toward nutrient-rich non-staples, they are still far below what is required for healthy diets. Food-based dietary guidelines offer a recommended intake of the various food groups required for a healthy diet. Recent estimates suggest.\nData source: TARINA Baseline and Midline Survey\nSome of the underlying factors that have resulted in such high rates of malnutrition in Bihar and the rest of eastern India are low levels of agricultural productivity, low per capita GDP with a high share of agriculture in GDP, and urbanization.\nThe rest of this report presents a food systems framework that comprehensively addresses these factors, together with those that determine individual-level nutrient status.\nAverage Price per kg of Food Group (USD, 2019 PPP)\nData source: TARINA, Baseline (2016–17) and Midline (2018–19) Surveys\nBox 2.4 | Cost of Diets in Munger from TARINA’s Market Diversity Study\nThe TARINA market diversity study collected high-frequency data on the availability and prices of nearly 250 food items in rural markets (haats) in Munger from June 2018 to May 2019. Using the prices from the study, we estimated how much an individual will have to spend each day to meet the global dietary recommendations put forward by the EAT–Lancet Commission in 2019.\nHouseholds in Munger were spending an average of US$1.20 per person per day on food purchased from the market. This suggests that, on average, per capita spending on food will have to increase fourfold. The bulk of this increase comes from non-staples, like leafy vegetables, meats, and dairy products.\nOur results indicate that the EAT–Lancet diet will cost nearly US$5.00 per person per day if individuals purchase the average cost food items in each food group. The biggest deficit in spending on actual diets, relative to the EAT–Lancet recommendations, is centered around food groups such as meats and dairy, which correspond to the relatively higher market prices for these food groups.\n“To ensure that a nutritious diet is affordable, food systems will need to be reoriented in ways that make such foods accessible and affordable to all.”\nAgriculture–Nutrition Pathways for Achieving the SDG2 Goal in Bihar\nIn this section, we highlight the four main pathways by which agriculture can influence nutritional outcomes for individuals and households: increased incomes, year-round access to diverse foods, equitable intrahousehold food allocation, and nutrient absorption. The first two pathways determine household food access while the latter two are instrumental in determining individual-level nutrition outcomes.\nFor smallholder farmers in India, incomes are a function of productivity, market linkages, and nonfarm opportunities. Household access to diverse foods largely depends on proximity to markets, on-farm diversification, and safety-net programs. Intrahousehold allocation depends on women’s empowerment, while nutrient absorption is determined by factors like clean water and sanitation. Readers are referred to Pingali and Sunder (2017) for a detailed discussion of this framework.\nPathway 1: Agriculture as a Source of Household Income\nNearly two-thirds of India’s population is rural, and one-third of the rural population depends on agriculture as a source of livelihood. In this context, an increase in agricultural productivity can increase incomes, resulting in improved nutritional outcomes. Higher incomes allow rural households to purchase diverse foods, invest in health care and sanitation, and protect against shocks, like those resulting from poor harvests. Rao and Pingali found that, for rural households in India, a 10-percentage point increase in agricultural income was associated with a 0.10 percentage point growth in women’s BMI over a period of four years.\nPathway 2: Household Access to Diverse Foods\nHouseholds can access a nutritionally diverse basket of foods through three main sources: own-production, markets, and safety-net programs. A diversification of production at the farm level can allow households to access and consume a diverse set of foods throughout the year. Such a relationship, however, is more likely in instances where market integration is less developed, as in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Production and consumption decisions decouple as market integration increases, allowing households to purchase foods from local markets, subject to household incomes and market prices.\nAccording to Bennet’s Law, as household incomes increase, households spend a greater share of income on non-staples, resulting in demand for a diversified diet. An increase in the supply of diverse foods in local markets can ensure that diverse foods are available and at affordable prices to the rural poor. In addition to own-production and markets, households also rely on various kinds of safety nets to access food. One example is India’s Public Distribution System (PDS), which provides subsidized staple grains.\nPathway 3: Intrahousehold Food Allocation\nWhich foods are consumed by different members of the household, and in what quantity and frequency, can determine eventual nutritional outcomes. Women often tend to eat last and eat the least. This, in turn, results in poor health outcomes for both women and children. Research indicates that, in India, women’s empowerment in agriculture has a significant association with their dietary intake and micronutrient status, such as iron deficiency. Ensuring women’s input in production decisions, access to resources like credit, and encouraging their participation in self-help groups are avenues for improving empowerment levels. Women’s time use between agriculture and non-agricultural activities is also an important factor that determines nutritional outcomes.\nPathway 4: Health Environment\nThe\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TARINA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>TARINA conducts surveys and studies on food expenditures, malnutrition, and agricultural productivity in Bihar and eastern India)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in eastern India with high rates of malnutrition, low agricultural productivity, and a significant portion of GDP from agriculture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EAT–LANCET COMMISSION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Commission that put forward global dietary recommendations in 2019)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUNGER<|>GEO<|>Location in India where TARINA collected data on food availability and prices)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDIA<|>GEO<|>Country where Bihar is located and the focus of TARINA's studies and surveys)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SDG2<|>EVENT<|>Sustainable Development Goal 2, which focuses on ending hunger, achieving food security and improved nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TARINA<|>BIHAR<|>TARINA conducts studies on malnutrition and food systems in Bihar<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TARINA<|>MUNGER<|>TARINA conducted a market diversity study in Munger<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EAT–LANCET COMMISSION<|>MUNGER<|>Dietary recommendations by the EAT–Lancet Commission were used to estimate food spending in Munger<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>INDIA<|>Bihar is a state within India, facing specific challenges addressed in the TARINA surveys<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TARINA<|>SDG2<|>TARINA's work contributes to achieving the SDG2 goal in Bihar<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
