However, fallow land, both permanent and current, showed an increasing trend at 0.74% and 0.80% respectively, ultimately leading to the shrinkage in net sown area in the State.\nVII.4 Comparing the land use pattern in Bihar with that at the all-India level, it is observed that the area under forest showed an increasing trend in both Bihar (0.34%) and at the all-India level (0.20%). Land under non-agricultural use also increased, however, more at the all-India level (1.50%) than in Bihar (0.47%). In the case of miscellaneous trees, while Bihar showed an increasing trend (1.70%), it was declining at the all-India level (-0.80%). Fallow land, both permanent and current, increased in Bihar as well as at the all-India level. However, the rate of increase in permanent fallow was more for Bihar (0.74%) than at the all-India level (0.58%). The rate of increase in current fallow was more at the all-India level (1.19%) than in Bihar (0.80%). Net sown area declined both in Bihar and at the all-India level. However, the rate of decline was significantly high in Bihar at (-)0.77% as against (-)0.05% at the all-India level.\nb) Land Use Pattern - Regional Analysis\nVII.5 Across different zones, the net sown area constituted around half of the reporting area in the northern plain areas. However, in the plateau region, the net sown area constituted only one-fourth (25.21%) of the reporting area, while around one-third of the area (29.46%) was under forest. In all the four agro-climatic zones, the net sown area showed a declining trend. The rate of decline was as high as (-)1.54% in the plateau region and as low as (-)0.47% in the south-west alluvial plains. Part of the decline in net sown area was due to expanding areas under miscellaneous trees and other waste land, particularly in the north-west alluvial plains and the east alluvial plains. In the plateau region, increasing current fallow and barren land contributed more to the declining net sown area. In the south-west alluvial plains, part of the decline in net sown area was caused by expanding other waste land and barren land.\nc) Intensity of Land Use for Crop Culture\nVII.6 The land available for cultivation cannot be expanded in the short run, given the physical constraints on the one hand and limitations of resources for investments on the other. In such a situation, the other alternative to maximize crop output is to raise more crops in different crop seasons on the same piece of land. In other words, it implies raising crop intensity of the land. In the context of declining net sown areas, raising crop intensity assumes more importance. Implicitly, crop intensity is influenced largely by favorable monsoons on the one hand and availability of modern technology, mainly irrigation, on the other. Over these years, there have been rapid strides in the expansion of improved technologies in Bihar agriculture as well. Before addressing the question of what the determinants of crop intensity are and whether it has kept pace with increasing use of modern technologies, it is more pertinent to examine how it varies across different agro-climatic zones/districts and what has been the trend in its growth over a period of time.\nVII.7 Crop intensity for Bihar was 136.1% in 1990-91. Over the years, it showed a marginal improvement in crop intensity from 129.0% in 1971-72 to 135.2% in 1981-82 and 136.1% in 1990-91. Compared to the all-India average of 130.4%, Bihar presents a better picture in crop intensity. However, in comparison to cropping intensity in states like Punjab (177.7%) and Haryana (165.4%), it is much less in Bihar. States such as West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, and Orissa were also ahead of Bihar with crop intensity at 162.5%, 147.3%, and 152.2% respectively. All these states gained in crop intensity in the range of 27.5% as in Orissa to 10.8% as in Uttar Pradesh, whereas in Bihar it improved by 5.5% only over the same period.\nVII.8 Across different agro-climatic zones/districts, the plateau districts showed relatively low crop intensity at 109% only. Among the alluvial plains, it was relatively high in the north-west zone (149%), followed by the east zone (143%). The south-west zone showed crop intensity at 140%. Analyzing crop intensity across different districts, it is observed that districts such as Darbhanga, Gopalganj, and Siwan in the north-west plains showed high crop intensity at 171%, 184%, and 165% respectively. Districts such as Muzaffarpur, Saran, and Vaishali had moderately high crop intensity ranging between 150% and 155%. It was, however, much less in Madhubani (134%) and East Champaran (128%).\nVII.9 Among the districts of the east alluvial plains, only Begusarai, Katihar, and Saharsa showed relatively high crop intensity at 155%, 161%, and 154% respectively.
