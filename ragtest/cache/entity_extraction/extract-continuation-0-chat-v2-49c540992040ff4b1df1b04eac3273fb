His significant success came from selling Erica Palm, a decorative plant, which has helped him build a substantial working capital.\nEstablishing Nursery\nIn 2018, Thakur leased eight Katha of land in his village for Rs 12,000 annually and established a nursery. He received scientific and technical support from KVK, leading to the cultivation of medicinal plants like Ashwagandha, Kalmegh, Lemon Grass, and Tulsi.\nIncome and Future Plans\nThakur's business has grown substantially. He earns approximately Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 2 lakh annually from selling plants and providing maintenance services. Additionally, he earns around Rs 72,000 annually from vermicompost production. His cumulative income exceeds Rs 4 lakh per annum. Thakur aims to expand his business further by supplying plants to more households and commercial establishments.\n\n12. Chunchun Kumar\nAge: 44 years\nVillage: Ramnagar Bartara\nPanchayat: Suari Immamnagar\nBlock: Ramgarh Chowk\nDistrict: Lakhisarai\nVenture: Lathyrus Farming\nEducational Qualification: Graduation\nInstitution Facilitating Venture: Bihar Agricultural University, Sabour\nAdoption of New Lathyrus Varieties Increases Profit Earning of Farmer\nChunchun Kumar, unlike many other farmers, never completely discontinued the cultivation of Lathyrus (grass pea). Despite its adverse effects on human health, he continued limited cultivation for utilizing rice fallow land and animal feed.\nTransition to New Varieties\nKumar has a 30-acre agricultural land and initially cultivated traditional crops like paddy and wheat. In 2018, he was informed by KVK and university scientists about two new Lathyrus varieties, Ratan and Prateek, developed to be safe for human consumption.\nMotivated by the scientists, Kumar started cultivating the new variety, Prateek, with 25 kilograms of seeds provided by KVK. His first-year yield of six quintals was sold to KVK at Rs 3,700 per quintal, providing him with a significant profit compared to the local variety.\nExpansion and Success\nEncouraged by the returns, Kumar expanded his cultivation to three acres in 2019 and recorded a yield of 15 quintals, which he sold to KVK at Rs 4,200 per quintal. In 2020, he further increased his cultivation to four acres and distributed seeds to fellow farmers.\nImpact and Adoption\nThe adoption of the new Lathyrus varieties has increased significantly in Kumar’s village and nearby areas. The Biotech Kissan Project has played a crucial role in promoting these new varieties, improving the overall income and health benefits for the farmers in the region.\n1. Raj Shekhar\nName: Raj Shekhar\nAge: 42 Years\nVenture: Katarni Farming\nVillage: Desari\nPanchayat: Bhawanipur, Desari\nBlock: Jagdishpur\nDistrict: Bhagalpur\nEducational Qualification: Intermediate Science (I. Sc.)\nInstitution Facilitating Venture: Bihar Agriculture University, Sabour\nBackground and Achievements:\nRaj Shekhar has continued cultivating the Katarni variety of paddy, a tradition followed by his family for generations. Despite initial low returns and challenges like qualitative degeneration, he chose to maintain the legacy due to the variety's fine grain quality and aroma.\nBy 2005, he began cultivating Katarni on his five-acre family land. Over time, despite facing issues with seed impurities and reduced yield, he persisted with the cultivation.\nThe Bihar Agricultural University (BAU) initiated a Katarni refinement project that led to the development of Suddh Katarni, which restored the quality of the variety. The GI tag was awarded to Katarni in 2017.\nRaj Shekhar's yield improved significantly with Suddh Katarni, reaching up to 12 quintals per hectare. His net income increased to slightly above Rs 2 lakh per annum.\nHe has also started organic farming of Katarni and plans to expand this practice, selling organic produce at Rs 6000 per quintal.\n2.

His business employs 14 people and generates an annual gross turnover of Rs 70 lakh.\nHe received the national dairy award in 2011 and the best farmer award from Bihar Agricultural University (BAU).\n3.
