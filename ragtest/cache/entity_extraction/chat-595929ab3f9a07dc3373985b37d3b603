Executive Summary\nThe State of Bihar, with a geographical area of 94.2 thousand square km, is divided by the River Ganges into two parts: North Bihar, with an area of 53.3 thousand square km, and South Bihar, with an area of 40.9 thousand square km. Based on soil characterization, rainfall, temperature, and terrain, three main agro-climatic zones in Bihar have been identified:\nZone I (North West Alluvial Plain)\nZone II (North East Alluvial Plain)\nZone III (South Bihar Alluvial Plain)\nEach zone has its own potential and prospects. All these zones have Chaur, Maund, Tal, and Diara lands, which are submerged during the rainy season.\nThe percentage of the population employed in agricultural production in Bihar is estimated to be 81%, which is much higher than the national average. Nearly 42% of the state’s GDP (2004-05) comes from the agriculture sector (including forestry and fishing). The high concentration of population, largely dependent on agriculture coupled with low yields of major cereal crops, is the main reason for the high poverty ratio in the state. Consequently, about 42% of the state population is below the poverty line compared to the national average of 26%. As urbanization in the state is still very poor, nearly 90% of the population lives in rural areas. Bihar also lags behind the national average on all socio-economic indicators like per capita income, average size of operational holdings, per capita cultivated land, percentage of village electrified, road length per thousand sq km, per capita deposit, per capita bank credit, credit-deposit ratio, male-female literacy, and life expectancy.\nThe gross and net sown area in the state is estimated at 80.26 lakh ha and 56.38 lakh ha, respectively. The intensity of cropping is 1.42%. The principal crops are paddy, wheat, pulses, maize, potato, sugarcane, oilseeds, tobacco, and jute. Rice, wheat, and maize are the major crops. The average yields of rice and wheat are 1.45 and 2.19 t/ha, respectively, compared to the production potential (experimental yields at research farms as well as realized in frontline demonstrations) of 4.5-5.0 t/ha. Similarly, the average maize yield of the state is about 2.38 t/ha compared to its yield potential of 6 t/ha. Winter maize is a success story, where farmers have realized yield levels of 6-8 tonnes/ha. Similarly, Boro Rice (summer rice) has a realization of 6-8 tonnes/ha. Even though the state is rich in soil and water resources, its average yields of rice, wheat, maize, and sugarcane are only about 32%, 44%, 40%, and 38% of the potential yields, respectively. Sugarcane production and the sugar industry hold great potential in Bihar. The state’s share in the country’s production is 4 to 4.5 percent and ranks 10th among the sugarcane-producing states. However, Bihar has the lowest sugar recovery rate in the country at 9% compared to the national average of 10.36%. Thus, there is considerable scope to increase the productivity of these important crops in Bihar. All these factors clearly reveal that Bihar has great potential to be a prosperous state.\nAlthough horticulture (fruits, vegetables including tubers and mushrooms, spices, honey, medicinal and aromatic plants) occupies 15% of the land area, the income generated from horticulture is much higher. The state has a monopoly in the production of litchi and makhana and continues to grow various fruits, vegetables, spices, and floriculture is catching the imagination of people, reflected in their growing interest across the state in the diversification of horticulture. Reviewing the current status, constraints, and potential, it is evident that there is ample opportunity for the development of horticulture in the state.\nBihar has a long history of chronically unprofitable state-owned companies and their unpaid staff. However, Sudha, a dairy cooperative, is a shining exception and one of the most successful enterprises of its kind in India. It has more than 6,000 outlets covering 84 towns and more than 260 villages. However, the health of animals and their productivity are causes of concern. Among livestock, cows and buffaloes are more important for value addition. Goat rearing and poultry also have much potential. Effective health management, breed management, and institutional support would be of great value to the people and the state.\nThe state, with its abundance of water bodies, has very high potential for fisheries and aquaculture, but this has not been fully realized. In the past, efforts were made to establish infrastructure through a World Bank-assisted project but with limited success. Main factors responsible for this are non-availability of fingerlings, scientific production systems, and policies. The state should bring the necessary aquarian reforms (granting rights of water bodies to fisher folks) and modernize its aquaculture industry through establishing competitive production and internationally accepted hygienic supply chains.\nDespite the strength of the agriculture sector, it is paradoxical that this sector is much below its potential. Agricultural productivity in Bihar was much better compared to other states in the 1950s but is now much below the national average. In the last two years, there has been appreciable growth due to improved seeds, technologies, and inputs, but there is still a long way to go to achieve responsive agriculture. This would require infrastructure, technology, and\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
