Need and Rationale for Fisheries Policy\nThe economy of Bihar is mainly dependent on agriculture, animal husbandry, and fisheries. Fisheries and aquaculture sector play a key role in food security and employment generation as a significant proportion of the population depend upon fisheries, aquaculture, and allied activities for their livelihood sustenance and income. Besides, the sector also generates precious revenue for the State. The importance of the fisheries sector to the State economy has increased particularly after the creation of Jharkhand as a separate State. The State has two distinct land masses on either side of the holy River Ganga and is divided into 38 administrative districts, 21 in North Bihar and 17 in South Bihar. Bihar, lying in the heart of Gangetic plain, is blessed with fertile land resources though extreme hot and cold climatic conditions along with flood and drought situations are characteristic parts of the geography.\nThe State is endowed with rich aquatic and fisheries resources in the form of rivers, flood plains, wetlands (chaurs), ox-bow lakes (mauns), reservoirs, tanks, and ponds. The main culture fishery resources of Bihar lie in over 43,000 ponds and tanks of variable sizes covering a total area of about 65,000 ha distributed throughout the length and breadth of the State. Flood plains and other wetlands locally known as chaur are other major fisheries resources and measure about 45,978 ha which are found mainly in the basins of Kosi-Gandak river systems of North Bihar. Estimates prepared by the Irrigation Department indicate several fold higher figures. Ox-bow lakes, locally known as mauns, are the discarded loops of meandering rivers which got cut off from the main rivers and is estimated to be about 9,000 ha. The 29 reservoirs in the State covering a total water spread area of about 11,000 ha is an important resource for fisheries development. Besides, 3,200 km of rivers are the main resource for capture-based fisheries in the State.\nThe annual fish production of the State, both from aquaculture and capture fisheries, has been estimated at 0.261 million tons against a demand of approximately 0.456 million tons. This has remained almost stagnant for many years. Evidently, there exists a wide gap between demand and supply, to the tune of 43%, which is quite paradoxical in view of the vast fisheries resources in the State. The unmet demand is partly met from the supply of fish from other States. Similarly, the annual demand of fish seed in the State is over 900 million, while the production is only about 350 million from the 121 government fish seed farms, two corporate-level fish hatcheries, and 26 private hatcheries.\nOn one hand, the State has huge underutilized and untapped fisheries resources which offers immense potential for fish production and scope for the development of rural livelihoods, while on the other, the State still depends for the supply of about half of its demand for fish from other states. The very low average productivity in all culture-based fisheries ecosystems, poor socio-economic condition of fishers and fish farmers, lack of adequate public and private investment and capital flow into the fisheries sector, lack of awareness about aquaculture as a viable and profitable economic activity, non-availability of adequate and professionally skilled human resources, ineffective and redundant service delivery systems, poor infrastructure facilities, etc., have all been responsible for the limited growth and development of the fisheries sector in Bihar. Thus there is an urgent need to bridge the gap between demand and supply of food fish and fish seed by effective and sustainable utilization of available resources.\nHowever, a favourable legal and institutional environment needs to be created to meaningfully address these challenges in order to produce adequate and cheap food fish for all and improve the quality of life of fishers and farmers. A comprehensive and enabling fisheries and aquaculture policy is a necessary prerequisite to provide overall direction, develop appropriate strategies, support implementation of development programs, and mobilise resources for the full-fledged growth and development of fisheries sector. In the changing scenario of globalization and increasing market integration, a dynamic policy is vital to steer the fisheries sector through the higher growth trajectory by tapping the new opportunities and tackling the impending challenges.\nThe overall objective of the fisheries and aquaculture policy shall be to increase the fish production on a sustainable basis to ensure food and livelihood security in the rural sector.\nWithin this broader context, the specific objectives of Fisheries Policy are:\nTo promote development and management of all fisheries and aquaculture resources to become a food and seed fish surplus State in an ecologically sound, economically viable, and socio-culturally compatible manner.\nTo provide adequate, sustainable, and equitable livelihood to fishers and fish farmers, and ensure availability of cheap and quality fish to all.\nTo generate entrepreneurial and employment opportunities, and facilitate creation of necessary infrastructure facilities through public and private investment in fisheries and aquaculture sector.\nTo conserve and manage the fisheries resources and fish biodiversity for its sustainable utilization.\nTo create wider social awareness about the importance of fisheries and aquaculture and promote consumption of fish as wholesome food.\nTo transform the Directorate of Fisheries\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The state government responsible for drafting and implementing the Fisheries Policy 2008 to promote sustainable livelihoods and economic growth in Bihar with attention to environmental, gender, socio-economic, and cultural concerns)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEPARTMENT OF ANIMAL AND FISH RESOURCES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A department within the Government of Bihar focused on the development and management of animal and fish resources, including drafting the Fisheries Policy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIRECTORATE OF FISHERIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A body under the Department of Animal and Fish Resources tasked with implementing the Fisheries Policy, managing fisheries resources, and providing extension services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India with significant agricultural, animal husbandry, and fisheries sectors, divided into 38 administrative districts and characterized by fertile land, extreme climate, and rich aquatic resources)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RIVER GANGA<|>GEO<|>A major river flowing through Bihar, dividing the state into two distinct land masses and playing a crucial role in the state's geography and economy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JHARKHAND<|>GEO<|>A state in India that was created from Bihar, affecting the economic significance of the fisheries sector in Bihar)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR<|>DEPARTMENT OF ANIMAL AND FISH RESOURCES<|>The Department of Animal and Fish Resources is part of the Government of Bihar and is responsible for the fisheries sector<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEPARTMENT OF ANIMAL AND FISH RESOURCES<|>DIRECTORATE OF FISHERIES<|>The Directorate of Fisheries operates under the Department of Animal and Fish Resources to implement fisheries policies and manage resources<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>RIVER GANGA<|>The River Ganga divides Bihar into North and South, significantly influencing its geography and economy<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR<|>BIHAR<|>The Government of Bihar is the governing authority of the state, responsible for its development and management, including the fisheries sector<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
