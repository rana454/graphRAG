Climatic and soil conditions of the state are congenial for the production of different types of vegetables. However, it lacks the basic infrastructure for storage, packaging, transportation, organized marketing systems, and post-harvest handling facilities. Seed is the most important input that influences the output of vegetable crops. Vegetable production programs could be strengthened only if its seed production program is improved. Thus, the seed production program should be strengthened to give a boost to vegetable production. (Annexure IX & X)\n\nSpices\n\nSpice Production\n\nA variety of spices are produced in Bihar. At present, Bihar produces about 20 thousand tonnes of spices annually from an area of nearly 15,081 ha. The important spices are Ginger, Turmeric, Chilli, Coriander, and Garlic. Chilli accounts for 47.6 percent of the area under spices and 39.5 percent of the production, followed by turmeric, which occupies 26.3 percent of the area under spices and accounts for 36.4 percent of the production in the state.\n\nArea and Production of Spices in Bihar\nFloriculture\n\nFloriculture Industry\n\nIn India, many states like Karnataka, Tamilnadu, Maharashtra, U.P., West Bengal, and Delhi are producing flowers on a large scale and are also involved in the export of some commercial flowers. However, Bihar does not play any role neither in export nor in the domestic market. The area under loose flower production in the year 2001–02 was 44 ha, which has increased to 95 ha in the year 2002-03. Also, the production reached 1757 MT in the year 2002-03. Although during the year 2004-05, the production of flowers increased tremendously after the adoption of Field Demonstration/ Training programs in the state under Macro Mode Management/National Horticulture Board-sponsored program, there is still a need to give more emphasis to exploit the potential of the state.\n\nApiculture\n\nHoney Production\n\nBihar is one of the leading honey-producing states in India. The main regions in which beekeeping is done are the districts of Muzaffarpur, Vaishali, Sitamarhi, East & West Champaran, Madhepura, Katihar, and Begusarai. Approximately 3,900 MT of honey was produced in the state out of the total country’s production of 8,400 MT in 2002. Bihar is the only state producing litchi honey on a commercial scale, and it should rank at par with some of the premium honey in the world market such as the Block Forest Honey of Germany and the Spanish Orange Honey in terms of its uniqueness and quality. Honey yield with the Italian honeybee species is the highest in Bihar as compared to other states with a production rate of 40 and 60 kg honey/hive/year under stationary and migratory beekeeping respectively. The processing industry has not kept pace with the increase in beekeeping in\n\nPoultry\nPoultry Share and Population Growth\nPoultry – primarily relating to egg production – has just a 1.6 percent share in the livestock value of the state. There is an increase in the fowl population in the state during the period from 1997 to 2003. The fowl population has increased by around 58.3%, and the population of ducks etc. has decreased by 37.5% during the period. The total poultry has increased by 42.5% during the period. (Annexure XIV)\nEgg Production and Supply\nEggs are available both from fowls and ducks. Over the years, egg production in the state also recorded a significant increase from 740 million nos. in 2001-02 to 1000 million nos. in 2005-06, over 35 percent increase. This was when the average yield of an improved layer was below 190 eggs per annum against a potential of over 350 eggs. On the other hand, productivity level of ‘deshi’ birds is less than 90 per bird per annum. It is estimated that only 10 percent of the requirement in the state is met by the production within the state. Although the demand for table eggs in the state is very high, the farmers are not very keen on commercial poultry development mainly due to longer gestation period, high feed cost, high overhead expenses due to smaller size of units, and poor infrastructure like power and transport. Lack of awareness on scientific management of poultry birds as well as perception of high risk in the activity by the bankers is also a serious constraint for the development of the sector. It is, however, encouraging noting that of late, the State Government is focusing on promoting layer farming and has accorded agriculture status to poultry farming. Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra are the two major states which have made commendable progress in poultry, and Bihar should learn from their experience. It is also necessary to develop proper marketing along with storage and transport facilities in the state. (Annexure XV) gives details about egg production by fowls and ducks in Bihar State.\nVeterinary Services, Extension, and Training\nInstitutional Setup\nThe number of institutions providing extension services to the livestock sector has remained stagnant over the years. There are 39 Veterinary hospitals, 814 Veterinary Dispensaries, and 29 mobile veterinary dispensaries under the State Animal Husbandry Department. As regards piggery, there is no pig breeding farm or bacon factory in the Government sector. (Annexure XVI)\nGoat and Sheep Breeding\nAs regards Goat, Beetal breed goat farm and sheep breeding farm at Chatra, Black Bengal goat farm at Thaithaitanger, Bolba (Gumla) are now in Jharkhand state and no sheep and goat\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India known for producing a variety of traditional and non-traditional vegetables, spices, and involved in floriculture and apiculture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUZAFFARPUR<|>GEO<|>One of the main regions in Bihar where beekeeping is done)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VAISHALI<|>GEO<|>One of the main regions in Bihar where beekeeping is done)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SITAMARHI<|>GEO<|>One of the main regions in Bihar where beekeeping is done)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EAST CHAMPARAN<|>GEO<|>One of the main regions in Bihar where beekeeping is done)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEST CHAMPARAN<|>GEO<|>One of the main regions in Bihar where beekeeping is done)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MADHEPURA<|>GEO<|>One of the main regions in Bihar where beekeeping is done)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KATIHAR<|>GEO<|>One of the main regions in Bihar where beekeeping is done)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEGUSARAI<|>GEO<|>One of the main regions in Bihar where beekeeping is done)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANDHRA PRADESH<|>GEO<|>A state in India recognized for its commendable progress in poultry farming)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHARASHTRA<|>GEO<|>A state in India recognized for its commendable progress in poultry farming)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>MUZAFFARPUR<|>Muzaffarpur is one of the main regions in Bihar for beekeeping<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>VAISHALI<|>Vaishali is one of the main regions in Bihar for beekeeping<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>SITAMARHI<|>Sitamarhi is one of the main regions in Bihar for beekeeping<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>EAST CHAMPARAN<|>East Champaran is one of the main regions in Bihar for beekeeping<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>WEST CHAMPARAN<|>West Champaran is one of the main regions in Bihar for beekeeping<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>MADHEPURA<|>Madhepura is one of the main regions in Bihar for beekeeping<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>KATIHAR<|>Katihar is one of the main regions in Bihar for beekeeping<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>BEGUSARAI<|>Begusarai is one of the main regions in Bihar for beekeeping<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>ANDHRA PRADESH<|>Bihar should learn from Andhra Pradesh's experience in poultry farming<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>MAHARASHTRA<|>Bihar should learn from Maharashtra's experience in poultry farming<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
