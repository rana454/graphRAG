A farmer of Katihar district, Singh, however, went ahead with his plan of growing dragon fruit overlooking the uncertainties. The risk taken by him paid dividends. Singh received quite encouraging initial market response for his produce.\nPrimarily involved in farming of paddy, potato, banana, and vegetables earlier, Singh decided in 2018 to explore the possibility of growing dragon fruit. Singh was looking for options to replace banana cultivation to some extent with another economically viable fruit when he came to know about nutrient-rich dragon fruit through YouTube. Though a bit hesitant initially, he subsequently decided to go ahead with farming of dragon fruit. Hopeful of a good harvest of dragon fruit, Singh looks forward to increasing his income substantially in the future through farming this relatively lesser-known fruit.\nInitially procuring 600 seedlings of dragon fruit from Kolkata at a rate of Rs 40 each, Singh started growing dragon fruit. Considering that dragon fruit plants are creepers, he erected a total of 230 cement poles in 10 Katha land out of his total five-acre agricultural land for growing the fruits. Singh planted four plants around each pole to facilitate proper growth and help the plants climb on cement poles.\nIn his attempt to experiment with the cultivation of a lesser-known fruit, he had the support of scientists and other personnel of Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), Katihar. The KVK scientists extended him all required technical and scientific assistance. Singh was also provided supplementary information related to dragon fruit by KVK personnel.\nHe reaped a harvest of 6-7 kilograms of dragon fruit in 2019 from seedlings he had planted around a pole in 2018. In light of the fact that dragon fruit production is substantially more in the second and third year compared to the first year, the total quantity of his produce increased substantially in subsequent years.\nThe first year proved really challenging for Singh in terms of selling his produce. Due to the fact that dragon fruit is a less known fruit in the state, he was virtually at a loss on how to sell his produce. KVK's handholding support also helped him in making the fruit popular in the area. To make the fruit popular, Singh gave it free of cost to some important people, including doctors in his area, who in turn helped in the promotion of the fruit by stating its nutritional value to others. He also approached fruit sellers to sell his produce.\nThe efforts of KVK as well as his individual effort to popularize the fruit helped Singh sell his two quintals of produce from the first year at Rs 200 per kilogram. His earnings from the sale of his produce in the first year were much less compared to his input cost. The input cost of Singh included an expenditure of Rs 1000 he had to incur on erecting each cement pole apart from his expenditure on the purchase of seedlings. Though farming dragon fruit was not economically viable for Singh in the first year, he was sure the next year would be different for him.\nIn 2020, he had 10 quintals of dragon fruit with an average yield of 10-15 kilograms from plants around each pole. Following increased production, things started looking up for him. The second year also proved significant for Singh as he received a supply order for dragon fruit from the adjoining Purnia district apart from places in Katihar district. In the second year, he was also able to sell his produce at a rate of Rs 200 and above per kilogram. The dragon fruit, having an average shelf life of nearly one month, allowed him to contact more fruit sellers and people interested in dragon fruit. Singh registered a gross income of above Rs 2 lakh in the second year. His second-year income helped him recover his input cost to a great extent. Singh is hopeful that in succeeding years, he would have above 24 quintals of harvest of dragon fruit. He is confident that from the third year onwards, his net income from dragon fruit farming would increase considerably. Singh, who on average earns Rs 2 lakh annually from the cultivation of conventional crops, looks forward to doubling his income through dragon fruit farming.\nThe fellow farmers, in a number of cases, discouraged Singh initially regarding farming of the relatively less known fruit. However, influenced by his success, some farmers have already started dragon fruit farming. Taking together Kodha and Pothia blocks of Katihar district, more than half a dozen farmers have started farming dragon fruit. Many others are also contemplating growing dragon fruit in the future.\n\nName: Sameer Chaudhary\nAge: 31 Yrs\nVenture: Mushroom Farming\nVillage: Semapur\nPanchayat: Bareta\nBlock: Barari\nDistrict: Katihar\nEducational Qualification: Master of Business Administration\nInstitution Facilitating Venture: Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Katihar\n\nMaster of Business Administration Registers Success in Mushroom Farming\nIt was a course of destiny that Sameer Chaudhary had to take up agriculture as a livelihood.

He received all required scientific and technical support from KVK.\nChaudhary, who joined the navy after 10+2 level education, had to return home due to his father's illness.
