However, the plateau zone experienced a shrinkage in HYV coverage for all three major crops: paddy, wheat, and maize.\niv) Regional Specificity: Expansion in HYV area for paddy and wheat was region-specific to districts with high production of these crops.\nv) Maize HYV Expansion: Despite a general declining trend in maize HYV area, districts such as Begusarai, Saharsa, and Purnea—having high maize production—showed an expansion in HYV area.\nvi) Irrigation and Fertilizer Influence: Districts with relatively high irrigation networks showed higher HYV coverage. Crops with high irrigation also exhibited higher HYV coverage. There was a strong positive elasticity between fertilizer consumption and HYV coverage.\nvii) Elasticity of HYV: Given the high yield augmentation effect of HYV, Bihar farmers did not wait for irrigation to use these seeds, as HYV area showed positive elasticity even in districts with low irrigation networks, particularly in the plateau zone.\n\nCHAPTER XI\nFlow of Institutional Credit\nXI.1 Importance of Credit\nCredit is crucial for achieving higher productivity and output of agricultural crops, particularly in resource-deficient regions with low investible surpluses. It facilitates the increased use of modern inputs at lower costs. To achieve enhanced flow of institutional credit, formal credit agencies expanded in Bihar, especially after the nationalization of banks. The branch network of scheduled commercial banks (CBs) in the state increased to 3,001, and Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) to 1,892 in 1993. Additionally, there were 34 District Central Co-operative Banks (DCCBs) with 494 branches and 6,967 Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) across the State in 1992. The Bihar State Land Development Bank (BSLDB) had 187 branches for financing investment credit in the State. This chapter examines and analyzes the flow of institutional credit in Bihar.\nXI.2 Assessment of Credit Requirement in the State\ni) Credit Requirements Estimates:\nThe Sen Committee (1982) estimated credit requirements—both short-term production credit and long-term investment credit—for Bihar agriculture at Rs. 1,505 crores for the VIIth Plan period and Rs. 1,870 crores for the VIIIth Plan period. Adjusted to current prices, this equated to Rs. 2,172 crores for the VIIth Plan and Rs. 4,039 crores for the VIIIth Plan period, translating to Rs. 434 crores per year for the VIIth Plan and Rs. 807 crores per year for the VIIIth Plan.\nThe Potential Linked Credit Plan (PLPs) of 1989-90 estimated the credit requirement for the rural and agricultural sector of the State at Rs. 601 crores for 1992-93.\nThe Task Force on Bihar estimated the credit requirement at Rs. 720 crores for 1993-94.\nXI.3 Credit Flow in the State\ni) Comparison with Estimates:\nThe actual flow of aggregate credit in the State during the VIIth Plan period was Rs. 1,068.7 crores in agriculture and allied sectors, which was only 49.2% of the estimated credit requirement. The initial years of the VIIth Plan saw even lower credit flows: Rs. 214.3 crores in 1991-92 and Rs. 195.7 crores in 1992-93. Compared to the Sen Committee estimates, actual credit flow was around one-fourth for the agriculture sector.\nEstimates from PLPs and the Task Force covered a broader range, including small-scale industries and tertiary sectors. The actual credit flow compared to the PLP estimate was around 35.03% in 1991-92 and around 27.03% of the Task Force estimate in 1992-93.\nii) Trends in Credit Flow:\nThere was a downward trend in credit flows, particularly in agriculture and allied sectors. Credit flow increased from Rs. 298.5 crores in 1986 to Rs. 524.0 crores in 1988-89 but then decreased to Rs. 289.5 crores in 1992-93. Agriculture and allied sectors followed a similar trend with Rs. 152.0 crores in 1986, rising to Rs. 308.0 crores in 1988-89, and then declining to Rs. 195.7 crores in 1992-93.\niii) Share of Agriculture:\nAgriculture and allied sectors continued to dominate in terms of share of total credit flow in the State, remaining around 50-58% up to 1990-91. From 1991-92 onwards, this share increased to 67.63% in 1992-93.\niv) Credit Flow per Hectare:\nThe flow of credit per gross cropped hectare in Bihar was Rs. 312, much lower than in other major states such as Rs. 5,961 in Kerala, Rs. 2,155 in Tamil Nadu, Rs. 1,189 in Punjab, and Rs. 1,101 in Andhra Pradesh. The all-India average was Rs. 708 per hectare. In Bihar, the share of PACS in total credit flow was 28.30%, compared to higher shares in Kerala (68.31%), Punjab (59.72%), and the all-India level (42.48%). The share of production credit was also disproportionately low in Bihar at 36.50% compared to higher percentages in other states.\nXI.4 Regional Disparity in Credit Flow\ni) Zone-wise Analysis:\nCredit flow was highest in the agriculturally developed south-west plains\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
