Compared to states like Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, it was much less.\nvii) Of the several sources of irrigation, tubewells followed by canal dominated in the State. Tubewell irrigation alone showed increasing trend while all other sources, including canal, were declining.\nviii) Across different agro-climatic zones/districts, the south-west plain was relatively more irrigated (81.14%). It was the least in the plateau zone (7.19%). Given the high irrigation potential of the north-west and east plains, coverage of irrigation at around 45.0% in these zones was low.\nix) Analysing the growth in canal irrigation, it is observed that while at State level it showed increasing trend, the north-west and plateau zones showed shrinkage. Districts to show high decline in canal irrigation included East Champaran, West Champaran and Gopalganj in the north-west plains; and Santhal Parganas in the plateau zone. In effect, there was a fall of 1.04 lakh hectares in canal irrigation (9.50% of canal irrigation) in all such districts during 1979-91.\nx) Tubewell irrigation increased in most of the districts, mainly in the plain land. There were, however, districts such as Muzaffarpur, Munger, Aurangabad and Rohtas where it showed shrinkage during 1977-91. The aggregate decline in tubewell irrigation in the State during this period was 0.49 lakh hectares which formed 3.53% of total tubewell irrigation in the State.\nxi) Irrigation through other wells was prominent in a few districts only, mainly in the plateau zone. However, most of these districts registered a decline in it, aggregating to 1.62 lakh hectares. This formed 124.5% of the irrigation through other wells in 1990-91.\nxii) Irrigation through ponds/tanks also showed sharp decline in the state, aggregating to 0.38 lakh hectares during this period. It formed 33.10% of the aggregate irrigation through ponds/tanks in the State in 1990-91.\nxiii) Irrigation intensity was low at 124% for the State as against 180% in Punjab, 163% in Haryana and 140% in Uttar Pradesh. Moreover, over the years it remained stagnant. Across different districts it was relatively high in Gopalganj (170%), Katihar (178%), Purnea (161%) and Rohtas (157%). It was quite low in Saran (93%), Sitamarhi (106%), Vaishali (107%) and Begusarai (107%). Districts with high irrigation intensity were largely those having largely canal and tubewell irrigation.\nxiv) Irrigation was used mostly for foodgrain crops with their share in gross irrigated area at 93.07% in 1990-91. Among the foodgrains, it was the cereals (92.89%) and of the cereal crops, it was paddy (45.55%), followed by wheat (40.08%) and maize (6.84%) which had dominant share in irrigation. Similar was the pattern of irrigation use across different agro-climatic zones, except the plateau where miscellaneous crops had a share of 29.20% in gross irrigated area. In districts such as Dhanbad, Ranchi, Hazaribagh and Giridih, the share of miscellaneous crops in gross irrigated area was still high exceeding 50.0%.\nxv) Examining the level of irrigation for different crops, the study showed that wheat with 85.52% of its area under irrigation had the highest coverage of irrigation. For maize and paddy, it was 43.15% and 35.47% respectively. Among the non-food crops, rapeseed/mustard and tobacco had higher levels of irrigation which also showed increasing trend.\nxvi) The study observed positive influence of irrigation on yield, fertilizer consumption and crop intensity. Crop diversification is not found to be influenced by irrigation.\nHYV Seeds\nxvii) Area under HYV seeds was expanding in the state. However, compared to states such as Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, coverage of HYV was quite low in Bihar.\nxviii) Paddy, despite being a dominant crop, had low HYV area at around 34.0% only as against 94.0% in Punjab and 87.0% in Uttar Pradesh.\nxix) While for paddy and wheat HYV area was increasing, in respect of maize it showed declining trend.\nxx) Across different agro-climatic zones, the HYV area was increasing in respect of paddy, wheat as well as maize in the plain land, but the plateau districts showed declining trend in respect of all these crops.\nxxi) Expansion in HYV area for wheat and paddy was region-specific. Spread of HYV area was relatively high in districts showing high production of such crops.\nxxii) Amidst general scenario of declining trend in maize HYV area, districts with high production showed increasing spread of HYVs.\nxxiii) Districts with high irrigation network showed higher coverage of HYV seeds. Similarly, crops with high irrigation showed higher coverage of HYVs. Again, the association between fertilizer consumption and coverage of HYVs was strong.\nxxiv) Given the yield augmenting effect of HYVs, farmers of Bihar do not seem to wait for irrigation for its use, as HYV area was observed to show high positive elasticity even in districts with low irrigation network, including plateau districts.\nFlow of Institutional Credit\nxxv) The gap between the credit requirements, as estimated by the Sen\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
