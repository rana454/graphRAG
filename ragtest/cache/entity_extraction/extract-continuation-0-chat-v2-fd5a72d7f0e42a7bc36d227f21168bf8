Jute production showed an increasing trend, although at a slackened rate during the second sub-period.\nThe increase in jute production was more due to yield increase, as area remained more or less stagnant. Production of jute was region-specific with the east plains having a dominant share. Districts such as Purnea, Katihar, and Saharsa were prominent in jute cultivation.\nPotato Production:\nIn potato production, the State was only next to Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. It showed an increasing trend in both sub-periods.\nThe increase in potato production was more due to area expansion, as yield showed a declining trend. The yield was disappointingly low (9.15 t/ha.) in the State compared to major potato-growing states.\nAcross different zones, the north-west plains had the lead in production. Among the districts, Samastipur, Purnea, Nalanda, and Hazaribagh were leading. In terms of rate of growth, however, Madhubani, Samastipur, Begusarai, and Palamu were leading, largely due to area expansion.\n\n22. Chilli Production Trends\nThe State excelled in chilli production till the early seventies. By the turn of the eighties, however, it was relegated to the bottom. The rate of decline in chilli production became sharp in the second sub-period ((-)11.99%), contributed by a decline in both area and yield. Further, production of chilli has been region-specific with the east and south-west plains leading. Among districts of these zones, it was produced largely in Begusarai and Rohtas.\n23. Narcotics and Beverages\nThe crop group of narcotics and beverages was not significant in the State. Among them, tobacco alone found a place of relative prominence, and the State ranked fifth in the country in its production. While most of the tobacco-growing states recorded significant increases in tobacco production, Bihar showed a declining trend during the eighties. It was largely due to a sharp decline in the yield level, as area showed an increasing trend. Production of tobacco was, however, specific to the north-west plains. Among the districts, Samastipur and Vaishali occupied prime positions in tobacco production, and both the districts showed an increasing trend in its production. Contrary to the general scenario, both area and yield of tobacco in these districts showed an increasing trend during the second sub-period.\nc) Cropping Pattern and Area Shift\nWith only 8.20% area under non-food crops, the agriculture of Bihar was largely subsistent. Among the foodgrains, cereal crops dominated (80.50%), whereas pulses formed only 11.27%. Across different zones, non-food crops were relatively more dominant in the north-west and east plains. Further, specific non-food crops were grown in specific districts. For instance:\nSugarcane: Cultivated in a cluster of districts such as West Champaran, East Champaran, and Gopalganj.\nRapeseed/Mustard: Concentrated in Purnea and Begusarai.\nJute: Dominated by a cluster of districts such as Purnea, Katihar, and Saharsa.\nChilli: Prominently produced in Begusarai and Rohtas.\nPotato: Prominent in Samastipur, Purnea, Gaya, Hazaribagh, and Ranchi.\nTobacco: Dominated by districts such as Samastipur and Vaishali.\nDistricts of the east plains were more dominant in the cultivation of diversified crops such as jute, chilli, and rapeseed/mustard.\n24. Area Shift Analysis\nAnalysis of area shifts across different crop groups suggested that:\nCereal Crops: Gained in area.\nSpices and Pulses: Lost their area during both sub-periods, though relatively less in the second sub-period.\nOilseeds, Fibres, and Fruits-Vegetables: Showed a loss of area during the second sub-period.\nBetween the superior and coarse cereals:\nSuperior Cereals: Gained in area marginally (e.g., wheat).\nCoarse Cereals: Lost their area almost in similar measure (e.g., small millets).\nAmong pulses:\nOther Pulses: Gained in area.\nMajor Pulses: Such as gram and arhar lost their area.\nAmong oilseeds:\nRapeseed/Mustard: Gained in area.\nLinseed and Nigerseed: Lost their area.\nAmong fibre crops:\nJute: Gained in area.\nMesta and Sunhemp: Lost their area.\nSimilarly, among spices:\nChilli: Lost its area.\nTurmeric: Gained in area.\nSugarcane and Tobacco: Gained in area, particularly during the second sub-period.\nd) Yield Increase - Crop-Wise Comparative Analysis\nAnalysing the comparative increase in yield of major crops, the broad conclusions are as follows:\ni) Declining Trend:\nJowar: (-6.47%)\nBajra: (-1.97%)\nChillies: (-2.49%)\nTobacco: (-2.98%)\nPotatoes: (-0.19%)\nii) High Rate of Growth in Yield:\nMaize: 5.14%\nSmall Millets: 4.27%\nRapeseed/Mustard: 3.07%\nSugarcane: 6.02%\niii) Modest Increase in Yield:\nPaddy: 2.27%\nRagi: 2.46%\nWheat: 2.19%\nOther Pulses: 2.23%\niv) Marginal Rate of\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>State in India known for its agricultural production, including jute, potatoes, chillies, tobacco, and various other crops)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PURNEA<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar prominent in jute cultivation and one of the leading districts in potato production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KATIHAR<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar known for its significant contribution to jute production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAHARSA<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar recognized for its jute cultivation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMASTIPUR<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar leading in potato and tobacco production, showing an increasing trend in agricultural growth)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NALANDA<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar noted for its potato production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAZARIBAGH<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar known for its potato production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MADHUBANI<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar showing significant area expansion in agriculture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEGUSARAI<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with a prominent production of chillies and rapeseed/mustard, showing an increasing trend in agriculture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PALAMU<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar noted for its agricultural area expansion)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROHTAS<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar known for chilli production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VAISHALI<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar occupying prime positions in tobacco production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEST CHAMPARAN<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar cultivated in a cluster for sugarcane production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EAST CHAMPARAN<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar known for sugarcane cultivation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOPALGANJ<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar part of the sugarcane cultivation cluster)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAYA<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar prominent in potato production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RANCHI<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar known for its potato production)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PURNEA<|>BIHAR<|>Purnea is a district in Bihar known for its significant contribution to jute and potato production<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KATIHAR<|>BIHAR<|>Katihar is a district in Bihar recognized for its jute production<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAHARSA<|>BIHAR<|>Saharsa is a district in Bihar recognized for its jute cultivation<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAMASTIPUR<|>BIHAR<|>Samastipur is a leading district in Bihar for potato and tobacco production<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NALANDA<|>BIHAR<|>Nalanda is a district in Bihar noted for its potato production<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAZARIBAGH<|>BIHAR<|>Hazaribagh is a district in Bihar known for its potato production<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MADHUBANI<|>BIHAR<|>Madhubani is a district in Bihar showing significant area expansion in agriculture<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BEGUSARAI<|>BIHAR<|>Begusarai is a district in Bihar with a prominent production of chillies and rapeseed/mustard<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PALAMU<|>BIHAR<|>Palamu is a district in Bihar noted for its agricultural area expansion<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROHTAS<|>BIHAR<|>Rohtas is a district in Bihar known for chilli production<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VAISHALI<|>BIHAR<|>Vaishali occupies prime positions in Bihar for tobacco production<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WEST CHAMPARAN<|>BIHAR<|>West Champaran is part of the sugarcane cultivation cluster in Bihar<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EAST CHAMPARAN<|>BIHAR<|>East Champaran is known for sugarcane cultivation in Bihar<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOPALGANJ<|>BIHAR<|>Gopalganj is part of the sugarcane cultivation cluster in Bihar<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GAYA<|>BIHAR<|>Gaya is prominent in potato production in Bihar<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RANCHI<|>BIHAR<|>Ranchi is known for its potato production in Bihar<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
