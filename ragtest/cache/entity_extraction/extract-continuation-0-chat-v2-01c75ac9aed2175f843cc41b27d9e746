Coverage of HYV maize area, however, was increasing from 48.12% in 1979-80 to 57.48% in 1990-91, recording a compound annual rate of growth of 1.94%. Despite the increasing share in percentage terms, the overall decline in maize area reduces the significance of this growth. Compared to other major maize-growing states, the coverage of HYV in Bihar was not encouraging. While it was as high as 75.47% in Andhra Pradesh, 100% in Maharashtra, 94.15% in Punjab, and 76.92% in West Bengal, Bihar had only 58.52% of maize area under HYV.\nX.5.2 Regional and District Analysis\nCultivation of maize in Bihar is region-specific, primarily in the north-west and the east plains. Coverage of maize HYV was relatively high in these zones, more so in the north-west plains (75.38%). In zones with lower maize cultivation, spread of HYV was also low. The plateau districts showed a virtual absence of HYVs, with a spread of only 9.96%. Notably, HYV area for maize was shrinking in all zones except the east plains. The north-west plains, a major maize production area, saw a decline in HYV area at (-)1.85% per annum during 1980-91. The plateau districts experienced a high rate of decline at (-)4.47% per annum, while the south-west plains saw a decline at (-)4.25% per annum. The east plains, however, showed an increasing trend at 1.53% per annum.\nX.5.3 District-Level Trends\nBegusarai, Saharsa, Purnea, and Samastipur were major maize-producing districts. All these districts, except Samastipur, showed an increasing trend in maize HYV area. Begusarai, which produced almost one-third of the state's maize, recorded an impressive growth rate (6.99% per annum) in HYV area. Samastipur, however, showed a shrinkage in HYV area under maize at (-)1.14% per annum. Other major maize-growing districts, including East Champaran, Gopalganj, Muzaffarpur, and Saran, also showed a decline in HYV area.\nX.6 Wheat\nX.6.1 Coverage and Growth Trends\nCoverage of HYV for wheat was relatively high, forming 74.50% of wheat area in 1990-91. However, its coverage has not increased significantly over the decade. While HYV wheat area formed 70.44% in 1979-80, it increased marginally to 74.50% in 1990-91, recording a compound annual rate of growth of 0.56%. In terms of physical area, the increase in HYV for wheat was more impressive, rising from 1.20 lakh hectares in 1979-80 to 1.46 lakh hectares in 1990-91, with a compound annual rate of growth of 2.51% during this period. The spread of HYV seeds for wheat was relatively low due to the neutralizing effect of the increasing wheat area itself. While area under wheat increased from 1.70 lakh hectares in 1979-80 to 1.96 lakh hectares in 1990-91 (an increase of 15.30%), the area under HYV seeds for wheat increased by 21.7% during the same period. Compared to other major states, the coverage of HYV for wheat in Bihar was low, with 96.33% in Punjab, 94.54% in Haryana, 93.40% in Uttar Pradesh, 100% in West Bengal, and 84.14% at the all-India level. Bihar's coverage was only 75.06%.\nX.6.2 Regional and District Analysis\nCoverage of HYV area under wheat was high in zones/districts with high wheat production. For instance, the north-west plains, with relatively high wheat production (40.93%), showed relatively high coverage of HYV (78.80%). The south-west plains, with wheat production (35.41%), also had relatively high HYV coverage (73.51%). The plateau districts, with minimal wheat production (2.05%), had the least HYV coverage (35.72%).\nX.6.3 District-Level Trends\nAt the district level, similar patterns were observed. Districts such as Siwan, Saran, East Champaran, and Gopalganj in the north-west; Begusarai in the east; and Bhojpur and Rohtas in the south-west, with relatively high wheat production, showed high coverage of HYV in the range of 93.72% to 70.32%. Some districts showed high coverage of HYV despite being low wheat producers, such as Muzaffarpur (81.62%) and Samastipur (81.88%) in the north-west; Katihar (88.25%) and Saharsa (83.18%) in the east; and Dhanbad (92.42%) in the plateau zone.\nX.6.4 Growth Trends by Region\nAnalysis of the increase in the physical area of wheat HYV shows expansion across all plain zones at a uniform rate during 1980-91. It increased at a compound annual rate of growth of 2.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HYV AREA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Refers to the area under High Yielding Variety crops, specifically maize and wheat in this context, indicating agricultural practices aimed at increasing crop yields)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India where the cultivation of maize and wheat, particularly High Yielding Varieties (HYV), is analyzed)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANDHRA PRADESH<|>GEO<|>A state in India with 75.47% of its maize area under HYV)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHARASHTRA<|>GEO<|>A state in India with 100% of its maize area under HYV)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUNJAB<|>GEO<|>A state in India with 94.15% of its maize area under HYV)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEST BENGAL<|>GEO<|>A state in India with 76.92% of its maize area under HYV)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEGUSARAI<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar known for producing a significant portion of the state's maize and showing impressive growth in HYV area)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAHARSA<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar noted for its increasing trend in maize HYV area)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PURNIA<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar with an increasing trend in maize HYV area)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMASTIPUR<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar showing a shrinkage in HYV area under maize)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EAST CHAMPARAN<|>GEO<|>A major maize-growing district in Bihar with a decline in HYV area)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOPALGANJ<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar with a decline in HYV area for maize)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUZAFFARPUR<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar showing a decline in HYV area for maize)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SARAN<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar with a decline in HYV area for maize)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>HYV AREA<|>Bihar's agricultural practices include the cultivation of High Yielding Varieties of maize and wheat<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BEGUSARAI<|>BIHAR<|>Begusarai is a significant maize-producing district within Bihar<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAHARSA<|>BIHAR<|>Saharsa is recognized for its increasing trend in maize HYV area within Bihar<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PURNIA<|>BIHAR<|>Purnia is noted for its increasing trend in maize HYV area within Bihar<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAMASTIPUR<|>BIHAR<|>Samastipur shows a contrasting trend with a shrinkage in HYV area under maize within Bihar<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EAST CHAMPARAN<|>BIHAR<|>East Champaran is a major maize-growing district in Bihar with a decline in HYV area<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOPALGANJ<|>BIHAR<|>Gopalganj, a district in Bihar, shows a decline in HYV area for maize<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MUZAFFARPUR<|>BIHAR<|>Muzaffarpur, a district in Bihar, shows a decline in HYV area for maize<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SARAN<|>BIHAR<|>Saran, a district in Bihar, has a declining HYV area for maize<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
