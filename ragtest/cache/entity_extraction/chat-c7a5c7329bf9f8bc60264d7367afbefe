Crops such as chilli and tobacco recorded a reversal in their yield from an increasing trend in the first sub-period to a declining trend in the second sub-period.\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\nTREND AND PATTERN OF LAND USE - ZONE-WISE/DISTRICT-WISE ANALYSIS\nThe present chapter seeks to address the question of how the land use pattern has been changing over the years and how it varies across different agro-climatic zones/districts in Bihar. These questions assume significance in the context of output maximization on the one hand and constraints in the adaptation of modern technology on the other. This calls for the adoption of a land policy to ensure optimum use of land.\na) Land Use Pattern - An Aggregate Analysis\nVII.2 Despite vast geographical spread, the availability of agricultural land was relatively low in Bihar. It was 62.5% in the state as against 86.0% in Haryana, 86.7% in Punjab, 68.1% in Uttar Pradesh, and 66.5% in West Bengal. This was largely due to high forest area (17.0%) on the one hand and large non-agricultural land (18.1%) on the other. Net sown area was still low in Bihar at 45.40% as compared to states such as Haryana, Punjab, West Bengal, and Uttar Pradesh where it formed as high as 81.7%, 83.8%, 60.3%, and 58.1% respectively. In terms of per capita availability, the net sown area was low at 0.09 ha for Bihar as against 0.22 ha for Haryana, 0.21 ha for Punjab, and 0.12 ha for Uttar Pradesh. Again, the share of net sown area to total reporting area was found to be declining in Bihar over these years. It formed 49.38% in 1950-51, declined to 47.98% in 1980-81, and 45.40% in 1990-91. The rate of decline was (-)0.93% per annum during 1977-91. Part of the low net sown area could be seen in relatively high fallow land (10.42%), culturable waste (16.29%), and barren land (5.6%) in the state. At the all-India level, fallow land was only 7.36%, culturable waste was 4.95%, and barren land was 5.93%. In Punjab and Haryana, the share of fallow, waste, and barren land was relatively low at 4.50% and 6.60% respectively.\nVII.3 Barren land and cultivable waste land declined annually at (-)1.64% each in the state. However, fallow land, both permanent and current, showed an increasing trend at 0.74% and 0.80% respectively, ultimately leading to the shrinkage in net sown area in the State.\nVII.4 Comparing the land use pattern in Bihar with that at the all-India level, it is observed that the area under forest showed an increasing trend in both Bihar (0.34%) and at the all-India level (0.20%). Land under non-agricultural use also increased, however, more at the all-India level (1.50%) than in Bihar (0.47%). In the case of miscellaneous trees, while Bihar showed an increasing trend (1.70%), it was declining at the all-India level (-0.80%). Fallow land, both permanent and current, increased in Bihar as well as at the all-India level. However, the rate of increase in permanent fallow was more for Bihar (0.74%) than at the all-India level (0.58%). The rate of increase in current fallow was more at the all-India level (1.19%) than in Bihar (0.80%). Net sown area declined both in Bihar and at the all-India level. However, the rate of decline was significantly high in Bihar at (-)0.77% as against (-)0.05% at the all-India level.\nb) Land Use Pattern - Regional Analysis\nVII.5 Across different zones, the net sown area constituted around half of the reporting area in the northern plain areas. However, in the plateau region, the net sown area constituted only one-fourth (25.21%) of the reporting area, while around one-third of the area (29.46%) was under forest. In all the four agro-climatic zones, the net sown area showed a declining trend. The rate of decline was as high as (-)1.54% in the plateau region and as low as (-)0.47% in the south-west alluvial plains. Part of the decline in net sown area was due to expanding areas under miscellaneous trees and other waste land, particularly in the north-west alluvial plains and the east alluvial plains. In the plateau region, increasing current fallow and barren land contributed more to the declining net sown area. In the south-west alluvial plains, part of the decline in net sown area was caused by expanding other waste land and barren land.\nc) Intensity of Land Use for Crop Culture\nVII.6 The land available for cultivation cannot be expanded in the short run, given the physical constraints on the one hand and limitations of resources for investments on the other. In such a situation, the other alternative to maximize crop output is to raise more crops in different crop seasons on the same piece of land. In other words, it implies raising crop intensity of the land.
