It is a matter of concern that the deviation between the FHP and MSP for both paddy and wheat has increased in recent years. The average price difference between the MSP and FHP for the period 2008-09 to 2013-14 for paddy was 22.6 percent and for wheat, 10.2 percent (Figure 24). The low procurement ratio in the state is primarily due to the absence of infrastructure for marketing and, in particular, the lack of storage facilities, which the state is now endeavoring to build.\n\nKishore, Sharma, and Joshi (2014) highlight that the post-APMC era in Bihar seems to have been a mixed experience for different stakeholders. For farmers, the liberalized regime seems to have been similar to the APMC days. They continue to sell their produce to village aggregators, who take the collected produce to the nearby mandis, keeping farmers isolated from the institutional changes being effected in markets, at least in the short run.\n\nOn the other hand, the liberal market environment favors processing industries as they now have increased sourcing options without paying mandi taxes. However, the food processing industry is at a very nascent stage in Bihar and therefore these benefits are limited. At the national level, only 2 to 3 percent of total fruits and vegetables go through any kind of processing activity. However, for Bihar, food processing is much more important as the high-value segment dominates the agricultural output. Bihar produces around 10 percent of total vegetables in the country and around 5 percent of fruits, yet only 4 percent of total cold storages in India are in Bihar. Of the total 304 cold storages in Bihar, more than 75 percent were exclusively used for potatoes. Worse, a substantial number of cold storages have shut down in the recent past because they have become unviable. The assessment is that cold storages can become viable only if they have multi-product capability. The shortcomings in the quality and quantity of power supply in the state have also contributed to the closure of cold storages. In order to bolster cold storage construction, the Bihar Government has initiated a cold storage scheme under which cold storages with a capacity of 5 to 10 thousand tonnes can avail of a subsidy of 30 percent on capital expenditure. For a capacity of more than 10 thousand tonnes, the subsidy can be availed of to the extent of 35 percent. The maximum amount of subsidy is limited to Rs. 5 crore. Cultivation of fruits and vegetables is a risky activity due to high post-harvest losses because of their short shelf life. In order to minimize post-harvest losses, cold storages play an important role. According to a study, post-harvest losses in fruits and vegetables vary from 15-50 percent in Bihar (IL&FS, 2007).\n\nFurther, Bihar has ambitious plans to expand storage of food grains, the lack of capacity in which has been identified as one of the main impediments in increasing procurement. The estimated capacity needed is 12.61 lakh metric tonnes against which 6.98 lakh metric tonnes were in existence at the beginning of the year 2016-17. The plan is to make good the shortfall of 5.63 lakh metric tonnes during 2016-17 and to add a further capacity of 60,000 metric tonnes every year up to 2020-21.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FARM HARVEST PRICE<|>EVENT<|>The price at which farm produce like rice and wheat is sold, which has been consistently lower than the Minimum Support Price over a long period)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MINIMUM SUPPORT PRICE<|>EVENT<|>A government-set price at which it purchases directly from farmers, intended to ensure farmers a minimum profit for their harvest)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India experiencing challenges and changes in agricultural marketing, infrastructure, and food processing industry development)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APMC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Agricultural Produce Market Committee, involved in regulating market practices in agricultural produce in India.
