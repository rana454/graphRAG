Concentrating on the crop sector, it was set with the broad objectives of examining the growth performance of agricultureâ€”both food and non-food crops, sources of growth, crop pattern and area shifts, changes in land-use pattern, growth in use of inputs such as fertilizer, irrigation, HYV seeds, and credit, and analyzing operational holdings and tenancy status in the state. The analysis was based on secondary data covering the post-green revolution period 1971-93 at the state level and 1977-91 at zone/district level. Major findings of the study along with policy implications are summarized below.\nPerformance of Agriculture\nGrowth Performance of Foodgrains Production\nThe growth performance of foodgrains production in the state at 0.48% per annum was one of stagnation till 1982-83. The period from 1983-84, however, witnessed an accelerated growth rate at 2.73% with a low coefficient of variation. It compared well with the growth rates experienced in agriculturally developed states during the eighties.\nMuch of the increase in foodgrains production during 1984-93 in the state was in rabi season (4.93%), whereas kharif season production continued to stagnate (0.59%). Accelerated growth rate in rabi foodgrains output was seen in both area and yield increase. Stagnant kharif foodgrains production was largely due to a sharp decline in kharif area at (-)1.32% per annum.\nAnalyzing the growth performance across different agro-climatic zones, the study observed plateau districts to lag behind. The zones of alluvial plains, particularly the South-West Plains, recorded accelerated growth rates, comparable to the rate of growth achieved by agriculturally developed states during the eighties. High growth districts generally did not form one geographical cluster.\nNon-Food Crops\nWith only 10% area under non-food crops, the agriculture of Bihar continued to be largely subsistence in character. Production of some specific non-food crops, however, registered an increase in specific regions. For instance, sugarcane picked up fast in the North-West, and rapeseed/mustard in the East Plains. Over the years, area shifts were taking place in favor of superior cereals.\nCereal Crops\nAmong the cereal crops, wheat (3.80%), followed by paddy (3.50%) showed relatively high growth rates. For wheat, both area and yield contributed to growth. In the case of paddy, growth was due to yield increase, as area showed shrinkage. Summer and winter paddy production witnessed impressive growth performance in the state.\nPulses\nAmong pulses, production of arhar and gram witnessed reversal largely due to area shrinkage. Districts in the plateau region, however, showed a steady growth trend in their production.\nStatus of Agriculture\nComparison with Other States\nDespite accelerating growth rates in foodgrain as well as non-foodgrain production, the status of agriculture in Bihar was not comparable to agriculturally developed states or even the all-India average. With similar area, West Bengal produced more than double the paddy output in Bihar. Similarly, Haryana with half of the area produced almost equal wheat output to Bihar. The case of other crops such as maize, arhar, gram, sugarcane, rapeseed/mustard, and potato was not different. This was largely because the yield of these crops in Bihar was much less than those in agriculturally developed or other states. Moreover, the yield gap between the potential and the actual was large at 50-70% in the state, depending upon the crop and irrigated condition.\nFactors Influencing Growth of Agriculture\nFertilizer\nConsumption of fertilizer increased from 9.06 kg/ha. in 1970-71 to 57.02 kg/ha. in 1992-93. However, it lagged far behind Punjab (162.2 kg/ha.), Haryana (107.0 kg/ha.), Uttar Pradesh (86.0 kg/ha.), and all-India average (67.1 kg/ha.). Across zones/districts, it was relatively high in regions with high foodgrains production. It was positively related to the irrigation network as well. Some districts with low irrigation network in the plains also showed relatively high consumption of fertilizers, influenced possibly by normal rainfall.\nIn terms of composition, fertilizer use was unbalanced in the state, more in favor of nitrogen (67.5%) and deficient in phosphorus (22.5%) and potash (10.0%). Unbalanced use of fertilizer was excessive in zones/districts with high production of foodgrains as well as irrigation network. With elasticity of foodgrains yield to nutrient ratio index being negative, the adverse impact of such an unbalanced use of fertilizer was clearly discernible and, therefore, called for gearing up the agricultural extension network in the state, promoting balanced use of fertilizer as well as enhanced use of manure and compost in the state.\nIrrigation\nDespite vast irrigation potential, the availability of irrigation in only 43.0% of net sown area was much less in the state. Over the years, it was not increasing either. The fall in net irrigated area by 1.04 lakh hectares for canal, 0.49 lakh hectares for tubewells, 1.62 lakh hectares for other wells, and 0.38 lakh hectares\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
