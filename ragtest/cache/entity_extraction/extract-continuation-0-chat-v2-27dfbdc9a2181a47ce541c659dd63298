The focus in organic agriculture is to provide toxin-free food for the customer and the farmer growing it using organic inputs. Organic agriculture is a process that imparts sustenance and minimizes the ecological footprint.\n\n“Organic” denotes a label for products that have been produced in accordance with certain standards during food production, handling, processing, marketing stages, and certified by a duly constituted certification body or authority. The organic label is therefore a process claim rather than a product claim. Often, customers feel that organic foods are healthier and purer. The label does not mean that. It simply means that the products follow defined standards of production and handling. So an organic standard will not exempt producers and processors from compliance with general regulatory requirements like food safety regulations, pesticide registrations, general food, nutrition labeling rules, etc.\n\nTo facilitate trade and avoid misleading terms, the Codex Alimentarius, a joint body of FAO/WHO, framed certain guidelines for the production, processing, labeling, and marketing of organically-produced food. It defines organic agriculture as a holistic food production management system which promotes and enhances agro-system health, including biodiversity, biological cycles, and soil biological activity. The long-term objective of the FAO Organic Agriculture Programme is to enhance food security, rural development, sustainable livelihoods, and environmental integrity by building the capacities of member countries in organic production, processing, certification, and marketing.\nSoil Health Management\nSoil is a valuable national and natural resource. We depend on it. Soil conservation practices are very useful for Bihar, which is ridden with floods and drought. The prime focus of organic agriculture is the management of soil organic matter to enhance the chemical, physical, and biological properties of soil. The concept of feeding the soils rather than the plants forms the basis of the sustainable approach. One of the basic principles of soil fertility management in an organic system is that plant nutrition depends on ‘biologically derived nutrients’. Instead of using soluble forms of nutrients, less available forms of nutrients in organic matter are used. The nutrients are released by the activities of soil microbes and soil animals. Improved biological activity and diversity are also known to suppress weeds, pests, and diseases.\n\nKeeping soils in place is the beginning of conservation, but they should also function well. Soil organic matter cannot be increased quickly even when management practices that conserve soil organic matter are adopted. The increased addition of organic matter associated with continuous cropping and the production of higher crop yields are accompanied by an increase in the rate of decomposition. Moreover, only a small fraction of crop residues added to soil remains as soil organic matter. After an extended period of time, the return of all crop residues and the use of forages in rotations with cereals and oilseeds may significantly increase soil organic matter, particularly the “active” fraction.\n\nOrganic Matter and Composting Techniques\nForms of Organic Matter Used\nThe various forms of organic matter used are:\nAnimal dung\nCrop residues\nBio-gas slurry\nGreen manures\nBio-solids from agro-industries, food industries, and allied industries\nAnimal dung is also used competitively for fuel purposes. Composting techniques like vermi-composting, phospho-composting, and N-enriched phospho-composting are used to improve the nutrient-quality potential of composts. Vermi-composting is the easiest form of composting, which can be initiated on the farmer’s field by training and demonstration. The seed bank for earthworms can be set up by the soil testing labs, and every gram panchayat can distribute the worms at subsidized costs for preparing vermin-beds on-farm.\nDecomposition of Organic Material\nThe decomposition of organic material involves both physical and chemical processes:\nPhysical Decomposition: Results from the activities and appetites of various invertebrates such as mites, millipedes, beetles, sowbugs, earwigs, earthworms, slugs, and snails.\nChemical Decomposition: Results predominately from soil microorganisms, including bacteria, actinomycetes, fungi, and some protozoans. Under appropriate conditions, complex organic compounds present in food scraps and yard trimmings are enzymatically degraded into smaller compounds, carbon dioxide, and water. Heat is also generated as a by-product of this oxidative process. Composting continues as long as appropriate microorganisms are present and adequate environmental conditions are maintained. Once the decay process is completed, the non-degradable organic matter becomes the characteristic humus-like material called compost. Various compost inoculants are available which, after creating amenable conditions for composting [C\nratio of substrate, moisture, aeration], can bring down the time required for composting.\nFunctions of Soil Organic Matter\nNutrient Cycling\nIncreases the nutrient holding capacity of soil (CEC).\nIs a pool of nutrients for plants.\nChelates (binds) nutrients, preventing them from becoming permanently unavailable to plants.\nProvides food for soil organisms from bacteria to worms. These organisms hold on to nutrients and release them in forms available to plants.\nWater Dynamics\nImproves water infiltration.\nDecreases evaporation.\nIncreases water holding capacity, especially in sandy soils.\nStructure\nReduces crusting, especially in fine-textured soils.\nEncourages root development.\nImproves aggregation, preventing erosion.\nPrevents compaction.\nOther Effects of Soil Organic Matter\nPesticides break down more quickly and can be “tied-up” by organic matter (and clays).\nAgricultural Waste and Its Potential\nAccording to a conservative estimate, around 600 to 700 million tons per annum of agricultural wastes are available in our country, but most of it is not used properly. Such a rich source of fixed carbon can be converted into wealth by mobilizing the bio-mass to feed the soil. About 1800 million tons of animal dung is produced annually in our country.
