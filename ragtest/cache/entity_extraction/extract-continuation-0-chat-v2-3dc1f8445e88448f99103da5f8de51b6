For example, an earthquake causes huge losses to property supporting economies dependent on agriculture, livestock, or fishery. The higher the losses, the concomitant payouts are higher. So, the insurers have an incentive to spend more on investing in building earthquake-resistant structures.\nChallenges and Justifications\nAlthough traditional insurance mechanisms are in place throughout the country, some risks are too large to be easily mitigated or self-insured at the farm/household level. When insurance services are available to transfer such non-diversifiable risks, farmers are able to avoid other more costly risk management strategies and have resources available to recover should the insured event occur without the need to liquidate productive resources for consumption smoothing.\nDesigning and implementing a risk transfer mechanism for individuals for ‘extreme weather’ events would involve operational challenges in the nature of huge transaction and administration costs for settlement of claims. Also, considering the lower probability of such events, individual households may ignore the need for hedging for such low-probability events. In contrast, delivering to aggregators substantially cuts down on the transaction cost.\nThe above are some of the reasons which justify the aggregation of systemic ‘extreme weather’ risk cover at the state level. As a pilot, this aggregation could be done at the Local Government level.\nInferences for Agricultural Risk Initiatives\nWith adequate provision of well-designed production and price risk management products and systems, the existing gaps can be reduced, and higher sustainability can be induced consequent upon the following facts:\nThe rice-wheat cropping system occupies more than 70% of the gross cropped area, but productivity has remained low despite favorable soil, water, and climatic conditions.\nThis decline in productivity is basically due to the replacement of upland rice by higher income-generating crops like pulses, oilseeds, and maize.\nWheat production in the state suffers from problems such as delayed sowing, increased cost of production due to the rise in cost of petroleum oil, lack of small-duration varieties that can be appropriately tailored into the rice-wheat system, and aberrations in weather conditions.\nThe yield per hectare of maize and pulses is higher than the all-India average. Maize production is also very good, and Bihar is one of the leading states in maize production. Maize has multiple uses (e.g., baby corn, sweet corn, popcorn, and green corn) and is commercially very profitable. It is now replacing upland rice in the Kharif season and wheat in the Rabi season.\nThe sugar industry is the largest agro-based industry in Bihar. It generates considerable employment in the farm sector directly and through ancillary industries and related activities. According to estimates of 2006-07, the area under sugarcane cultivation is 117.2 thousand hectares, production accounts for 5338.8 thousand tons, and productivity is 45552 kg/ha against the national average of 70469 kg/ha. Bihar has the lowest sugar recovery rate in the country at 9% against the national average of 10.36%.\nThe potential of commercial horticulture and apiculture is also huge.\nAdditional Avenues to Insure Farm Incomes:\nAs identified in the background document, given the role of livestock and fisheries as a potential livelihood-transforming avenue, there is an urgent need to develop innovative productivity and life insurance covers in these sectors.\nGiven the huge gaps in credit requirements and actual disbursements, an effort is needed to deliver the developed insurance products through the channels of Self-Help Groups (SHGs), Farmer Clubs (FCs), ATMAs, extension systems, and other distribution channels in the rural markets of the state.\nEven if there is potential for raising the yield level in Bihar, low productivity and low profitability would stand in the way of realizing such potential. Unless paddy and wheat cultivation in Bihar is made profitable, farmers may not be induced to invest in land improvement measures for productivity growth, and the much-desired acreage shift towards paddy and wheat in Bihar at the expense of area loss in Punjab and Haryana may not be forthcoming. Even maize does not seem to be a very promising crop in this regard. With around 90 percent of small/marginal farmers, the marketable surplus is not expected to be very high. All the same, market arrival of rice and wheat is of the order of 20-25 percent. But the quantity procured is rather negligible. This serves as one of the biggest disincentives for higher production of major commodities in the state.\nSince the plan envisages a much higher level of production, there is a need for improvement in the marketing system, density of markets, connectivity of the markets within the producing areas, dissemination of market intelligence, and institutional arrangement for procurement of the produce which comes to the market. Adding insurance and risk management to this strategy indeed becomes a win-win for the development of agriculture and for sustaining the livelihoods of the farmers of Bihar.\nCHAPTER-10\nDEVELOPMENTAL STRATEGIES, POLICIES & INSTITUTIONAL DIRECTIONS\n201. Given the low average yields of most commodities, the huge gaps between the demonstrated and generally realized yields, the low farmers’ income, and widespread rural poverty on one hand, and the richness of the natural resources and the socio-political expediency to liberate the people of Bihar from the poverty and hunger trap on the other hand, a focused strategy and policy direction needs to be adopted on a priority basis. A holistic system-based approach, is therefore, needed to simultaneously enhance productivity, profitability, equity, and environmental sustainability through synergistically integrating crop, horticulture, livestock, fisheries, agroforestry\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>Bihar is a state in India facing challenges in agriculture productivity and profitability, with a significant portion of its economy dependent on agriculture, including crops like rice, wheat, and maize, and industries like sugar production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RICE-WHEAT CROPPING SYSTEM<|>EVENT<|>A major agricultural practice in Bihar, occupying more than 70% of the gross cropped area but suffering from low productivity despite favorable conditions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAIZE PRODUCTION<|>EVENT<|>Agricultural activity in Bihar, noted for its high yield per hectare and significant role in the state's economy, replacing upland rice and wheat in certain seasons)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUGAR INDUSTRY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The largest agro-based industry in Bihar, crucial for employment in the farm sector and characterized by low sugar recovery rates compared to the national average)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMERCIAL HORTICULTURE AND APICULTURE<|>EVENT<|>Identified as having huge potential in Bihar, contributing to the diversification and profitability of agriculture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIVESTOCK AND FISHERIES<|>EVENT<|>Sectors identified for innovative productivity and life insurance covers to transform livelihoods in Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SELF-HELP GROUPS (SHGS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Entities involved in delivering developed insurance products in rural markets of Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FARMER CLUBS (FCS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Groups involved in the distribution of insurance products to support farmers in Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT AGENCIES (ATMAS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Agencies involved in the extension and distribution of insurance products in Bihar's agricultural sector)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RICE-WHEAT CROPPING SYSTEM<|>BIHAR<|>The rice-wheat cropping system is a major agricultural practice facing productivity challenges in Bihar<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAIZE PRODUCTION<|>BIHAR<|>Maize production is a significant agricultural activity with high yields contributing to Bihar's economy<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUGAR INDUSTRY<|>BIHAR<|>The sugar industry plays a crucial role in Bihar's agro-based economy and employment<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMMERCIAL HORTICULTURE AND APICULTURE<|>BIHAR<|>These sectors are identified as having huge potential for contributing to agricultural diversification in Bihar<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LIVESTOCK AND FISHERIES<|>BIHAR<|>Sectors with potential for livelihood transformation through innovative insurance covers in Bihar<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SELF-HELP GROUPS (SHGS)<|>BIHAR<|>SHGs play a role in delivering insurance products in Bihar's rural markets<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FARMER CLUBS (FCS)<|>BIHAR<|>Farmer Clubs are involved in distributing insurance products to support Bihar's agricultural sector<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT AGENCIES (ATMAS)<|>BIHAR<|>ATMAs contribute to the extension and distribution of insurance products in agriculture in Bihar<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
