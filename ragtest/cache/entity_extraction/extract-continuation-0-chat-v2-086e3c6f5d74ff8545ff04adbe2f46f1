Among the major gram growing districts, the increasing trend was found to be accelerating only in:\nPatna (0.65%)\nPalamu (0.92%)\nDarbhanga (0.51%)\nIn the case of Bhojpur (-0.23%) and Rohtas (-0.25%), the increasing trend was observed to be decelerating. In Bhagalpur, the declining trend was found to be decelerating (-0.24%).\nIV.5.6 Area under Gram\nThe area under gram showed a sharp shrinkage in the state. It was as high as 244.40 thousand hectares in 1970-71, which increased initially to 266.60 thousand hectares in 1972-73, but continued to decline thereafter, reaching the lowest level at 124.30 thousand hectares in 1992-93, with an index number at 51 points only. The trend growth rate was observed to be declining at (-2.40%) per annum during 1971-93. The rate of decline was almost uniform in both sub-periods. It was (-2.59%) in the first sub-period and (-2.40%) in the second sub-period.\nIV.5.7 Inter-State Comparison\nInter-state comparison of area under gram suggests that Bihar was way behind other states, holding the seventh position in the country. While it occupied 2333.43 thousand ha in Madhya Pradesh and 1376.80 thousand ha in Rajasthan, it was a mere 146.90 thousand ha in Bihar during 1990-93. It formed only 2.25% of the gram area of the country. Comparing the trend rates of growth with major gram growing states, it is observed that the rate of decline in area was relatively low in Bihar. For example, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, the major gram growing states, showed expansion in gram area at 1.18%, 2.50%, and 4.01% per annum during 1983-93. Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Haryana, on the other hand, showed shrinkage in gram area at (-2.89%), (-1.73%), and (-5.22%) per annum, respectively, as against (-2.37%) in Bihar during the same period.\nIV.5.8 Regional Pattern\nIn terms of area, the south-west plains dominated with a share of 54.17% in the State gram area. Districts with relatively high area under gram included:\nSouth-West Plains: Bhojpur (11.79%), Patna (10.23%), and Rohtas (13.35%)\nPlateau: Palamu (7.39%) and Santhal Parganas (3.14%)\nEast: Munger (9.59%) and Bhagalpur (6.60%)\nNorth-West Plains: Darbhanga (2.36%), Saran (1.60%), and Siwan (1.45%)\nIV.5.9 Trend Growth Rates in Area\nFurther, shrinkage in area under gram was observed in all the four agro-climatic zones, however, varying from a high rate of decline at (-4.40%) in the north-west alluvial plains to a low of (-1.51%) in the south-west alluvial plains. The zone of plateau districts showed equally high levels of shrinkage at (-3.91%) during this period. East alluvial plains, on the other hand, showed a modest rate of shrinkage at (-2.43%). Between the two sub-periods, the second sub-period witnessed a slackened rate of decline in respect of north-west alluvial plains from (-6.43%) to (-4.21%) and east alluvial plains from (-2.72%) to (-1.12%). Shrinkage in area was, however, accelerated in the plateau districts from (-3.36%) to (-4.14%). The south-west alluvial plains experienced reversal from a declining trend in the first sub-period to an increasing trend in the second sub-period.\nIV.5.10 Yield of Gram\nThere has been a definite increase in the yield of gram over these years in Bihar. It was 0.71 thousand tonnes/ha in 1970-71, which declined initially to reach the lowest level at 0.44 thousand tonnes/ha in 1973-74 but showed an increasing trend thereafter, reaching the maximum level of 1.02 tonnes/ha in 1991-92 with an index number reaching 143 points. The trend rate of growth during 1971-93 thus showed an increase at 2.14% per annum. Analysis of the trend rates of growth in two sub-periods suggests that although it showed an increasing trend in both periods, the rate of increase was higher during the second sub-period (1.35%) than the first sub-period (0.48%).\nIV.5.11 Comparative Yield\nComparing the yield level across major gram growing states, it is encouraging to observe that Bihar figured at the top with a yield level of 0.91 tonnes/ha during 1990-93 as against 0.87 tonnes/ha in Uttar Pradesh, 0.61 tonnes/ha in Rajasthan, 0.50 tonnes/ha in Maharashtra, 0.76 tonnes/ha in Madhya Pradesh, and 0.68 tonnes/ha in Haryana. In terms of growth as well, it showed an encouraging picture for Bihar. It grew annually at 2.22% in Bihar, 1.57% in Madhya Pradesh, and 0.59% in Uttar Pradesh during 1983-93.
