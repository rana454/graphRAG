Farmers and farm-women trained were 44,623 covering 1,589 courses. Rural youth trained were 8,604 during the period covering 410 number of courses. While extension functionaries were trained through 264 number of courses involving 6,574 beneficiaries.\nCaste-wise participation in the training programmes shows that in Jharkhand, the participation of farmers including farm women from the schedule tribe category was to the extent of 39 percent but from the schedule caste category, it was 24.9 percent. The analysis indicates that farmers of lower socio-economic status are steadily approaching KVKs for their betterment through training. The major areas covered were integrated crop management, seed production, soil and water conservation, soil fertility management, cropping system, integrated farming system, resource conservation technology, water management, nursery management, integrated pest management, rejuvenation of old orchards, gender mainstreaming through SHGs, integrated nutrient management, management of farm animals, livestock feed and fodder production, etc.\nBoth on and off-campus courses were conducted by the KVKs as per the merit and requirement of course content.\nIn Jharkhand, 1,121 demonstrations covering 162 ha in rabi oilseeds, 253 demonstrations in 59 ha in kharif oilseeds were conducted. In both rabi and kharif pulse, Jharkhand took the lead with 314 and 710 demonstrations, respectively. The total area coverage in rabi was 47 ha and kharif 148 ha, in pulses. In crops like paddy, wheat, vegetables, etc., 2,484 demonstrations were made in 589 ha. The total number of beneficiaries was 4,882 in rabi and kharif season 2012-13.\nSeed Production\nAvailability and accessibility of quality agricultural inputs at an affordable price are the prerequisites for the development of agriculture. Production of quality seed, the most important agricultural input, needs to be augmented for the state of Jharkhand to bring about the desired change in the present agricultural scenario. However, inadequacy of quality seeds is one of the major bottlenecks in enhancing productivity. KVKs had taken up the seed production of crops like wheat, lentil, paddy, mustard, chickpea, and vegetables which includes hybrid seeds of paddy, wheat, and vegetables, for ensuring proper supply of quality seeds to the farmers.\n\n Livestock Rearing\nThe state of Jharkhand has high potential for prospering in the livestock sector with assured scientific knowledge of rearing, improved foundation stock, and regular vaccination. Among the livestock reared, pig, goat, and poultry at the backyard level can create opportunities to provide employment to seasonally employed rural farmers and supplementary income to improve their living standards. In assessing the feasibility of large-scale backyard livestock rearing, the KVKs have provided the knowledge of scientific livestock farming with T&D breed of pig, Black Bengal goat, and Divyayan Red/Vanraja/Gramapriya poultry breeds. Along with scientific management, the KVKs have also provided low-cost housing made with locally available resources, low-cost feed made with local ingredients, and large-scale vaccination camps at regular intervals. The efforts of KVKs have not only empowered the farm women of the state but also made the T&D breed of pig immensely popular in Purulia, Birbhum, and Bankura districts of West Bengal.\n\nPromotion of Appropriate Crop Varieties\nRice Varieties for Upland and Medium Land\nThe KVKs put their efforts into promoting several rice varieties for upland and medium land situations, such as Anjali, Vandana, Birsa Vikas Dhan-101, and Birds Vikas Dhan-110. The performance of the varieties promoted in the districts of Bokaro, Chatra, Dhanbad, East & West Singhbhum, Lohardaga, Latehar, Dumka, Hazaribag, Ranchi, and Gumla has shown an increase in productivity to the extent of 72-80 percent with more than 30 percent profitability. In most of the districts, the expansion of area under the promoted varieties has also taken place to nearly 30 percent.\nIn medium land situations, the introduced varieties namely Naveen, Sahabhagi, Abhishek, and Lalat have recorded 25-35% more productivity with 30 percent profitability. In almost all the districts, nearly 50 percent of the land has been brought under these varieties.\nIn wheat, introduced varieties like K-9107, DBW-14, DBW-17, and DBW-39 for normal sown irrigated conditions in the districts of West Singhbhum, Giridih, Palamu, Sahibganj, Jamtara, Ranchi, Saraikela, Pakur, and Garhwa have helped in enhancing wheat productivity to the extent of 30-35 percent followed by 25 percent profitability. Area expansion has also taken place by 20 percent under the identified varieties.\nIn pigeon pea, varieties like ND-1, Asha, Malviya, Birsa Arhar-1, and ICPH-2671 introduced by KVKs in the districts of Bokaro, Dhanbad, Lohardaga, Latehar, West Singhbhum, Giridih, Palamu, Sahibganj, Dumka, Ranchi, Garhwa, Hazaribag, Godda, Gumla, and Koderma have shown an increased productivity of 60-70 percent. The performance of the varieties has also helped in bringing more areas (30%) under the varieties with profitability of nearly 30 percent\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
