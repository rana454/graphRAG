Biofortified crops could also be grown through the JEEViKA groups and supplied to Anganwadi, schools, and the PDS program. Take Home Rations (THR), prepared and supplied by JEEViKA groups to the Anganwadi, could be scaled up under appropriate food safety regulations for locally processed food.\n\n8.2 Use of Locally Produced and Procured Material\nThe use of locally produced and procured material for preparing the THR would provide a boost to the local economy and ensure livelihoods for women. The Department of Food and Consumer Protection must be involved for changes to PDS supplies. Together with the Food Corporation of India (FCI), it must develop a mechanism for decentralized procurement and supply of millets, pulses, and other biofortified crops. Bihar could follow the direction of Chhattisgarh and Uttarakhand by providing 1 kg of pulses per person per month through the PDS.\n8.3 Ensuring Demand for and Purchase of Micronutrient-Rich Food in the Market\nPolicy convergence for a nutrition-secure Bihar can also be conceptualized for the demand side. For starters, agricultural policies geared toward diversification with pulses, millets, and poultry and dairy value chains, as well as management of fisheries, can be targeted toward women. Empowered women, with cash in their hands, can both demand and access nutrition-rich food for their families. If appropriate market linkages and price signals are in place, production of diversified crops can ensure that incomes reach the hands of women. Technology and market support for women can help them to increase their incomes, which can then be directed toward higher demand for nutrition-rich food. Incomes for women can also be ensured through the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), which through its projects can have the benefits of income generation paired with investments in soil and water conservation across the state. In addition to produce sales, demand for micronutrient-rich foods can also be met by encouraging households to cultivate annual nutrition gardens that will take care of some of their vegetable requirements throughout the year, especially green leafy vegetables.\n8.4 Investing in Women’s Empowerment and Positive Nutrition Behavior\nWomen’s empowerment in agriculture should be leveraged as a pathway for improved nutritional outcomes. Extension services and input providers should ensure that women are able to access and own inputs of production, like land, seeds, fertilizers, and credit. At the same time, technologies that reduce women’s drudgery and time spent in agriculture should be promoted. Policies should focus on linking women to output markets by way of improved infrastructure and farmer producer organizations (FPOs). Such steps will ensure that women have access to income, which in turn can spur the demand for nutritious foods. At the same time, women can play an important role in influencing intrahousehold food allocation.\nPositive nutrition behavior campaigns that address these issues can be implemented by bringing together government departments, development sector organizations, and public and private sector companies like ITC and NTPC, who have a presence in Bihar. For instance, the Department of Health can bring in their own expertise on the health aspects of improved behavior change practices. Agencies like Care India and Project Concern International can play a critical role in building the capacities of JEEViKA’s frontline and community-level staff and volunteers for behavior change campaigns. More than 900,000 women’s self-help groups have been formed across Bihar. These social capital-rich women’s institutions are being leveraged for various livelihood programs. These institutions also offer a wonderful opportunity to layer programs related to women’s empowerment and positive nutrition behavior. The Departments for Women and Child Development and for Education can work closely with the JEEViKA program to ensure that there is convergence in their efforts.\n8.5 Increasing Investments in Water and Sanitation\nWASH infrastructure in Bihar has been significantly improved in the last decade. There is now a need to build on those investments with regard to nutrition security. On the one hand, there is a need to ensure that all households have access to piped drinking water that is free from contaminants. This can be coordinated through the activities of the Departments of Public Health Engineering, Education, and Health and Social Welfare. On the other hand, there is a need to reinforce behavior change that is geared toward good hygiene practices. Departments like WCD, Health, and Education can design complementary BCC campaigns centered on these practices. The convergence of such efforts around the JEEViKA groups would catalyze these efforts and bring in an element of self-policing at the community level. The Department of Agriculture will also need to join forces with the Department of Health to address risks related to food safety, such as mycotoxin contamination, and crop cultivation, such as waterborne diseases from standing water.\n9 Recommendations\nInvest in the Agricultural Sector for Enhancing Incomes for Farmers\nThis report has presented a food systems approach for achieving SDG2—zero hunger—in Bihar. Central to that approach is the role that agriculture plays for improved nutritional outcomes. This is especially relevant for Bihar, where the rural population relies on agriculture as its main source of livelihood and bears the main burden of malnutrition. Small landholding size, low private investment, slow rates of technology adoption and farm mechanization, and recurrent incidents of flood and drought constrain agriculture in Bihar. Seed replacement rates for oilseeds and pulses are relatively low, while postharvest losses of horticultural crops like lychee and mangoes are high. To make matters worse, credit and marketing are weak, while connectivity, storage, and processing infrastructure are poor. Additional investments are required in all areas, including increasing the share of consumption of electricity for agricultural purposes that can kick-start the process of agricultural transformation in the state. There is a need for investment in the management of floods in north Bihar and in watershed and\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JEEVIKA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group involved in preparing and supplying Take Home Rations (THR) to Anganwadi, schools, and the PDS program, and scaling up food safety regulations for locally processed food)##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND CONSUMER PROTECTION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Involved in changes to PDS supplies and works with the Food Corporation of India to develop mechanisms for decentralized procurement and supply of millets, pulses, and other biofortified crops)##\n(\"entity\"<|>FOOD CORPORATION OF INDIA (FCI)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Works with the Department of Food and Consumer Protection to develop mechanisms for decentralized procurement and supply of millets, pulses, and other biofortified crops)##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>State in India focusing on nutrition-secure policies, including diversification with pulses, millets, and poultry, and leveraging women's empowerment for improved nutritional outcomes)##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHATMA GANDHI NATIONAL RURAL EMPLOYMENT GUARANTEE ACT (MGNREGA)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A government program aimed at providing employment opportunities and ensuring incomes for women, paired with investments in soil and water conservation)##\n(\"entity\"<|>ITC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Private sector company with a presence in Bihar, involved in positive nutrition behavior campaigns)##\n(\"entity\"<|>NTPC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Public sector company involved in positive nutrition behavior campaigns in Bihar)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARE INDIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Development sector organization playing a critical role in building capacities of JEEViKA’s staff and volunteers for behavior change campaigns)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROJECT CONCERN INTERNATIONAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Agency involved in building capacities of JEEViKA’s staff and volunteers for behavior change campaigns)##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Government department in Bihar bringing expertise on health aspects of improved behavior change practices)##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEPARTMENTS OF PUBLIC HEALTH ENGINEERING, EDUCATION, AND HEALTH AND SOCIAL WELFARE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Departments involved in ensuring access to piped drinking water and reinforcing good hygiene practices)##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Needs to join forces with the Department of Health to address food safety risks and crop cultivation issues)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JEEVIKA<|>DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND CONSUMER PROTECTION<|>JEEViKA collaborates with the Department of Food and Consumer Protection for scaling up food safety regulations<|>5)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND CONSUMER PROTECTION<|>FOOD CORPORATION OF INDIA (FCI)<|>Works together to develop mechanisms for decentralized procurement and supply of food crops<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>MAHATMA GANDHI NATIONAL RURAL EMPLOYMENT GUARANTEE ACT (MGNREGA)<|>MGNREGA projects in Bihar aim at income generation and investments in soil and water conservation<|>6)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ITC<|>NTPC<|>Both companies are involved in positive nutrition behavior campaigns in Bihar<|>4)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CARE INDIA<|>JEEVIKA<|>Care India builds capacities of JEEViKA’s staff for behavior change campaigns<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROJECT CONCERN INTERNATIONAL<|>JEEVIKA<|>Involved in capacity building of JEEViKA’s staff for behavior change campaigns<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH<|>BIHAR<|>Department of Health contributes to health and nutrition policies in Bihar<|>5)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEPARTMENTS OF PUBLIC HEALTH ENGINEERING, EDUCATION, AND HEALTH AND SOCIAL WELFARE<|>BIHAR<|>These departments ensure access to clean water and promote good hygiene in Bihar<|>6)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE<|>DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH<|>Need to collaborate to address food safety and crop cultivation in Bihar<|>5)<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
