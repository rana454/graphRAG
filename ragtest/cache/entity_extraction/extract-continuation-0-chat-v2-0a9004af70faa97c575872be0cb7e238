It may be taken to imply that in all these zones the land is being increasingly used more intensively for cultivation purposes. However, the zone of the plateau showed a declining trend at (-)1.02% per annum, implying thereby that intensive use of land is on the wane in this zone.\nVII.15 Crop intensity across different districts showed an increasing trend uniformly among the districts of the north-west alluvial plains. The rate of increase was as high as 1.50% in Muzaffarpur and as low as 0.08% in Saran. Amidst such a pattern, however, Madhubani and West Champaran showed a declining trend in crop intensity at (-)0.05% and (-)0.56% respectively. The pattern across the districts in the east alluvial plains was almost similar with most of the districts showing an increasing trend in crop intensity ranging between 0.93% as in Katihar and 0.06% as in Purnea. Munger was the only district in this zone to show a declining trend in crop intensity at (-)0.69% per annum. The pattern among the districts of the south-west alluvial plains was no different, as most of the districts showed an increasing trend of crop intensity in the range of 0.63% as in Aurangabad and 0.05% as in Patna. Districts of the plateau region, however, presented a picture in contrast with most of the districts showing a declining trend. The rate of decline ranged between (-)0.61% as in Santhal Parganas and (-)0.05% as in Hazaribagh. In contrast, Ranchi and Singhbhum showed an increasing trend in crop intensity at 3.80% and 0.09% respectively.\nConclusions\nVII.16 The following broad conclusions thus emerge on the basis of the foregoing discussions with regard to the trend and pattern of growth in the land use in Bihar:\n(i) Availability of land for cultivation was relatively low in Bihar. In a few districts, particularly the plateau districts, it was disproportionately low. Presence of high current fallow and other waste land suggests potential for bringing additional areas for cultivation in the state. The problem warrants immediate action in the context of net sown area showing a declining trend. It was precipitated largely due to an increase in other waste land and current fallow on the one hand and shift of land to miscellaneous trees as also for non-agricultural use on the other.\n(ii) Shrinkage in net sown area was uniform across all agro-climatic zones. However, the rate of shrinkage was more prominent and sharp in the plateau zone, followed by the east alluvial plains and the north-west alluvial plains. The south-west alluvial plains showed relatively low shrinkage.\n(iii) Area sown more than once showed an increasing trend in all the agro-climatic zones in the plain land, but declined in the plateau region. This implied that in the context of declining net sown area, the tendency to make more intensive use of land for cultivation was on the increase. But, much of the gains on this account were lost in view of the decline in net sown area, resulting in a trend of declining gross cropped area uniformly across all the agro-climatic zones.\n\nCHAPTER VIII\nGROWTH IN FERTILIZER CONSUMPTION - TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL PATTERN\nDiscussions in the preceding chapters brought out the fact that Bihar agriculture is on the growth path with production of foodgrains as also major non-foodgrain crops like oilseeds and sugarcane showing an upswing, especially since the mid-eighties. However, despite acceleration in agricultural production in the state, it is yet to catch momentum, given the richness of soil and climate. In lines similar to other agriculturally developed states like Punjab, Haryana, etc., with similar area under rice as in Bihar, states like West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh produced almost double of its rice output. Similarly, with half the area under wheat as in Bihar, Haryana produced almost similar levels of wheat. The case of sugarcane and oilseeds and a few other crops is no better. Such wide differentials in the production of agricultural crops in Bihar with those of other major states emanated largely because of wide differentials in the yield levels. Within the State, a wide variation was observed in the yield level across different agro-climatic zones and districts.\na) Consumption of Fertilizer\nVIII.3 Studies have found adequate evidence to suggest a significant influence of chemical fertilizer on yield and output level of crops, depending upon irrigated and unirrigated conditions as well as the nature of crop under cultivation. Mention may be made of studies such as Desai (1982), Mukhopadhyaya (1976), Nagraj (1980), NCAER (1978), Parikh and Trivedi (1982), etc. Increase in fertilizer consumption, however, did not match the pace of increase in foodgrains production. The growth in output is not commensurate with the increased fertilizer use as also observed at the all-India level, as reflected in the study by Parikh and Srinivasan (1974). Significantly, agriculture of Bihar has been responsive to\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NORTH-WEST ALLUVIAL PLAINS<|>GEO<|>Region showing an increasing trend in crop intensity, indicating more intensive land use for cultivation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EAST ALLUVIAL PLAINS<|>GEO<|>Region with most districts showing an increasing trend in crop intensity for cultivation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTH-WEST ALLUVIAL PLAINS<|>GEO<|>Region where districts mostly show an increasing trend in crop intensity, suggesting intensive cultivation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLATEAU<|>GEO<|>Region showing a declining trend in crop intensity, indicating a decrease in intensive land use for cultivation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUZAFFARPUR<|>GEO<|>District in the north-west alluvial plains with the highest rate of increase in crop intensity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SARAN<|>GEO<|>District in the north-west alluvial plains with the lowest rate of increase in crop intensity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MADHUBANI<|>GEO<|>District showing a declining trend in crop intensity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEST CHAMPARAN<|>GEO<|>District showing a declining trend in crop intensity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KATIHAR<|>GEO<|>District in the east alluvial plains showing an increasing trend in crop intensity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PURNIA<|>GEO<|>District in the east alluvial plains with a minimal increase in crop intensity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUNGER<|>GEO<|>District in the east alluvial plains showing a declining trend in crop intensity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AURANGABAD<|>GEO<|>District in the south-west alluvial plains with a significant increase in crop intensity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PATNA<|>GEO<|>District in the south-west alluvial plains with a minimal increase in crop intensity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SANTHAL PARGANAS<|>GEO<|>District in the plateau region with a notable decline in crop intensity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAZARIBAGH<|>GEO<|>District in the plateau region showing a decline in crop intensity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RANCHI<|>GEO<|>District in the plateau region showing an increase in crop intensity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SINGHBHUM<|>GEO<|>District in the plateau region with a slight increase in crop intensity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>State experiencing varying trends in land use and crop intensity across its agro-climatic zones and districts)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NORTH-WEST ALLUVIAL PLAINS<|>MUZAFFARPUR<|>Muzaffarpur is part of the north-west alluvial plains showing a high rate of increase in crop intensity<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NORTH-WEST ALLUVIAL PLAINS<|>SARAN<|>Saran is part of the north-west alluvial plains with the lowest rate of increase in crop intensity<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EAST ALLUVIAL PLAINS<|>KATIHAR<|>Katihar is a district in the east alluvial plains with an increasing trend in crop intensity<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EAST ALLUVIAL PLAINS<|>PURNIA<|>Purnea is a district in the east alluvial plains with a minimal increase in crop intensity<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOUTH-WEST ALLUVIAL PLAINS<|>AURANGABAD<|>Aurangabad is in the south-west alluvial plains and shows a significant increase in crop intensity<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOUTH-WEST ALLUVIAL PLAINS<|>PATNA<|>Patna is in the south-west alluvial plains with a minimal increase in crop intensity<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLATEAU<|>SANTHAL PARGANAS<|>Santhal Parganas is in the plateau region with a notable decline in crop intensity<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLATEAU<|>RANCHI<|>Ranchi is in the plateau region but shows an increase in crop intensity, contrasting with the general trend<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
