At present, only about 27% of the total area has been brought under culture fisheries with an average productivity of 300-500 kg/ha/year. The remaining areas support extensive capture fisheries as well as unscientific aquaculture.\nThe policy envisages scientific development of all flood plain wetlands for culture fisheries and aims to achieve an annual average productivity of 1000-2000 kg/ha/year. The strategy includes scientific and efficient utilization of flood plain wetlands, improving and upgrading their ecological status and water resources, introduction of improved culture practices and extension support, provision of adequate inputs and credit facilities, protection of wetlands from overexploitation and degradation, and strengthening of the institutional mechanisms for wetland management.\n\n6. Development of Reservoir Fisheries\nBihar has 29 reservoirs with a water spread of about 11,000 ha. The productivity of these reservoirs has been low compared to their potential. Reservoir fisheries are dependent on natural recruitment and occasional stocking of exotic species.\nThe policy proposes scientific management of all reservoirs and introduction of comprehensive fisheries development programs with improved stocking practices, efficient fishery management techniques, extension support, and infrastructure facilities. Productivity of reservoirs is to be increased to the level of 200-300 kg/ha/year with a focus on sustainable management practices and community participation.\n\n7. Development of Riverine Fisheries\nThe State has about 3,200 km of rivers which support capture fisheries. River fisheries are dependent on natural resources and face problems of habitat degradation, pollution, and overfishing.\nThe policy aims to enhance river fisheries through conservation of river habitats, regulation of fishing activities, promotion of sustainable fishing practices, and community involvement in river management. The strategy includes development of riverine fishery resources, ensuring sustainable fish production, and addressing issues related to pollution and habitat degradation.\n\n8. Seed Production and Supply\nThe annual demand for fish seed in Bihar exceeds 900 million while the production is only about 350 million from various sources. There is a need to enhance the seed production capabilities to meet the growing demand.\nThe policy proposes to strengthen existing fish seed production facilities, establish new hatcheries, and promote private sector participation in seed production. Measures will be taken to improve the quality of seed, ensure regular monitoring and certification, and facilitate distribution to fish farmers and aquaculture practitioners.\n\n9. Development of Fisheries Infrastructure\nInfrastructure development is crucial for the growth of the fisheries sector. The State needs to invest in various infrastructure facilities including cold storage, processing units, marketing facilities, and transportation.\nThe policy aims to create a comprehensive infrastructure development plan, attract private investment, and enhance existing facilities. Support will be provided for the establishment of cold storage units, fish processing plants, and marketing infrastructure to improve the overall efficiency of the fisheries sector.\n\n10. Training, Research, and Extension Services\nTraining, research, and extension services are essential for the successful implementation of the fisheries policy. Capacity building of stakeholders, development of new technologies, and dissemination of knowledge are critical components.\nThe policy proposes to strengthen training programs, promote research activities, and improve extension services. Collaboration with research institutions, universities, and other stakeholders will be encouraged to ensure the availability of updated knowledge and technologies.\n\n11. Legal and Institutional Framework\nA robust legal and institutional framework is necessary for effective policy implementation. This includes the development of regulations, enforcement mechanisms, and institutional arrangements.\nThe policy aims to review and update existing regulations, establish clear roles and responsibilities for different institutions, and ensure effective enforcement of laws. Institutional mechanisms will be strengthened to support policy implementation and facilitate coordination among various stakeholders.\n\n12. Financing and Investment\nAdequate financing and investment are crucial for the successful implementation of the fisheries policy. The policy proposes various strategies to mobilize resources and ensure efficient utilization.\nThe policy includes measures to attract public and private investment, facilitate access to credit, and utilize financial resources effectively. Support will be provided for the development of financial mechanisms and partnerships to ensure sustainable growth of the fisheries sector.\n\n13. Monitoring and Evaluation\nMonitoring and evaluation are essential for assessing the progress of policy implementation and making necessary adjustments. A systematic approach to monitoring and evaluation will be adopted.\nThe policy proposes to establish a monitoring and evaluation framework, set up performance indicators, and regularly review progress. Feedback from stakeholders will be collected and used to improve policy implementation and address emerging issues.\n\n14. Gender and Social Equity\nEnsuring gender and social equity is vital for inclusive development. The policy emphasizes the need to address gender disparities and promote social equity in fisheries development.\nThe policy aims to incorporate gender and social equity considerations in all aspects of fisheries development, including access to resources, benefits, and decision-making processes. Special attention will be given to the needs and aspirations of marginalized and vulnerable groups.\n\n15. Environmental Sustainability\nEnvironmental sustainability is a key concern in fisheries development. The policy emphasizes the need to protect and conserve aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity.\nThe policy includes measures to promote environmentally sustainable practices, address issues related to pollution and habitat degradation, and conserve aquatic biodiversity. Strategies will be developed to minimize the environmental impact of fisheries activities and ensure long-term sustainability.\n\n16. Stakeholder Participation and Community Involvement\nStakeholder participation and community involvement are crucial for effective policy implementation. The policy proposes to actively engage stakeholders and communities in decision-making processes.\nThe policy aims to strengthen mechanisms for stakeholder participation, encourage community-based management approaches, and promote collaboration among various actors in the fisheries sector. Stakeholders will be involved in planning, implementation, and monitoring of fisheries development programs.\n\n17. Conclusion\nThe Fisheries Policy of Bihar is a comprehensive framework aimed at achieving sustainable growth and development of the fisheries sector. By addressing key challenges, promoting effective strategies, and ensuring stakeholder involvement, the policy seeks to enhance fish production, improve livelihoods, and contribute to the overall economic development of the State.\nThe successful implementation of the policy will require collaborative efforts, commitment, and effective management.
