Though the share of anemic women in Bihar had declined from 68 to 60 percent between 2006 and 2016, the latest 2020 NFHS data indicate an increase in the past three years. The data also show that the initial decline was not sustainable, and the prevalence of anemia continues to be high, with rates for women nearly double that for men (Figure 2.10). In every district of the state, more than 50 percent of women are anemic (Figure 2.11). In districts like Araria, Supaul, and Purnea, the prevalence of anemia in women is almost 70 percent.\n2.2 Nutritional Status and Dietary Diversity in Bihar\nPoor Nutritional Status: Poor nutritional status, as measured by BMI, and micronutrient deficiencies like iron deficiency (which leads to anemia) are just one part of the malnutrition faced by women. Poor health can also result from an excessive intake of calories relative to essential micronutrients, as reflected in overweight and obesity. Obesity is a known risk factor for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. These diseases can increase the likelihood of health issues for future generations.\nIn Bihar, the share of men and women who are overweight or obese has tripled since 2005. Approximately 16 percent of men and women in Bihar were obese in 2020, compared to approximately 20 percent in India overall (Figure 2.12). Districts with a low proportion of underweight women have higher rates of overweight and obesity.\nDietary Diversity: While cereals like rice and wheat form the staple diet for most households, nutritional outcomes will depend on the consumption of non-staple food groups, such as dairy, pulses, leafy vegetables, fruits, eggs, meat, and fish.\nFigure 2.14 | Womenâ€™s Dietary Diversity in Bihar (2015): Dietary diversity refers to the number of food groups consumed by the woman in the previous 24 hours (panel a) and 7 days (panel b) respectively. The food groups considered are non-staples: dairy, pulses, green leafy vegetables, eggs, meat, fish, and fruits.\nData Source: NFHS-4 (2015-16)\nDiet Diversity:\nPanel a: Daily Diet Diversity\nPanel b: Weekly Diet Diversity\nConsumption Patterns: In this regard, data from the NFHS indicate that, on average, there is not a single district in the state where women reported having consumed more than 3 such non-staple food groups in the previous 24 hours. In most districts, this remains the case even for a weekly diet (Figure 2.14). Although at least 80 percent of women reported consuming legumes and green leafy vegetables, either daily or weekly, the share of women who consumed dairy products, fruits, eggs, meat, or fish is much lower.\n2.3 Transitioning Diets\nConventional Food Security Definitions: Conventional definitions of food security have focused on ensuring adequate food for populations so that caloric needs are met. Although outdated, National Sample Survey (NSS) data indicated that cereals accounted for 66 percent of calorie intake in India and 70 percent in Bihar. Vegetables and fruits, milk, and oils accounted for another 6 percent of calorie intake in Bihar, while the share of calories from eggs, fish, and meat was less than 1 percent (Figure 2.17).\nPer Capita Intake: Per person per day intakes of energy and protein in Bihar exceed that of the average for the country. However, per capita energy intake has declined from 2,096 kcal to 2,010 kcal from 2004â€“05 to 2011â€“12 and is lower than the recommended 2,155 kcal per person per day. Per person per day intake of proteins has remained unchanged at 58.1 g over the same time and exceeds dietary recommendations by 10 g. The intake of fat was 29.7 g per person per day, just above the recommended value of 28 g.\nFocus on Nutritional Security: In order to meet SDG2, the focus needs to shift from food security to nutritional security. The latter refers to ensuring that individual diets not only meet basic calorie requirements but also provide individuals with the required micronutrients. This requires that dietary intake be comprised not just of calorie-dense staple cereals like rice and wheat, but also non-staple food groups like dairy, pulses, meats, eggs, fruits, and vegetables, that together are rich in proteins, vitamins, and minerals. Such a focus on nutritious foods is important for Bihar, where diets have been primarily cereal-centric and access to and consumption of non-staples have been lagging.\nCost as a Constraint: A major constraint to households accessing diverse, nutritious foods is cost. A proxy indicator for food prices examines how much households are spending on different food groups. In Bihar, nearly 60 percent of total household expenditures was on food in 2019. This amounts to Rs. 4453.80 per household per month, on average.\n\nComposition of Monthly Food Expenditure in Bihar, by District (2019)\nCereals, vegetables, and dairy products each account for nearly one-fifth of monthly food expenditures. Fruits account for just 3 percent, while protein-rich foods, like meat, fish, and eggs, make up 15 percent of the total expenditure on food in any given month.\nAlthough the food expenditures described here reflect redistribution toward nutrient-rich non-staples, they are still far below what is required for healthy diets. Food-based dietary guidelines offer a recommended intake of the various\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
