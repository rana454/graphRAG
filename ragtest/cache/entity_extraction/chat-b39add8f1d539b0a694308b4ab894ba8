The weather insurance being a cover for covariant weather shocks and not idiosyncratic household risks specific to the farmer.\n(d) The provision of price risk products through a ‘Decision Support System’ coupled with an insurance cover could prove to be an ideal risk management strategy for poor households. There is a need to discover the feasibility of its delivery and also quantify the economic benefits to a poor household.\n(ii) Need to develop innovative weather risk management products (insurance and derivatives) and price risk management products (commodity futures)\nAs evident from the comparative scenarios described below, integrating Weather Risk Management and Price Risk Management strategies into the scheme of strategies developed for the development of agriculture in the state provides the much-needed cover against the evident risks of weather and price fluctuations and also becomes an incentive for farmers to graduate to more profitable and risky ventures that assure higher returns.\nIn a scenario without Risk Management:\nOptimum Inputs + Better Farm Management and Sustainable Agricultural Practices + Optimum use of technology + Better Storage, Processing and Marketing Infrastructure + Natural Resource Management + Optimum Credit + Crop specific recommended strategies + Weather Risk + Price Risk = Risk of Yield loss + Uncertain Cash flows in future\nIn a scenario with Risk Management:\nOptimum Inputs + Better Farm Management and Sustainable Agricultural Practices + Optimum use of technology + Better Storage, Processing and Marketing Infrastructure + Natural Resource Management + Optimum Credit + Crop specific recommended strategies + Weather Insurance/Weather Derivative Contract + Commodity Futures = Cover for losses due to Yield Loss + Cover for losses due to fall in Prices\n(iii) Need to invest in weather infrastructure\nThere is a need for investment in installing Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) and setting up a network/grid of weather sensors to generate the much-needed weather data for the state and develop monitoring systems to accentuate the design of index-based weather insurance as well as decision support systems or agriculture advisory services. (The low density of the existing IMD (India Meteorological Department), the unreliable revenue department rain gauges, and lack of transparent and updated weather data across multiple parameters like precipitation, relative humidity, temperature, etc., is a major constraint in developing reliable weather insurance products.)\n(iv) Need to factor Disaster Risk into the broad development paradigm\nWith the increasing frequency and severity of floods in Bihar, emerging risk transfer mechanisms will complement the risk reduction strategies of the Government. There is a definite need for factoring in the Risk from natural disasters into the development policies of the government.\n(v) Insurance as a Risk Hedging Mechanism\nThe risk transfer mechanism (insurance) product is part of risk transfer for floods although not being a risk reduction tool; it is bound to complement the risk reduction strategies. The insurance product is a financing mechanism and is not a mechanism to build any physical infrastructures that would help in risk reduction. But the financing mechanism, if implemented properly, would lead to building proper physical infrastructure that would help in mitigating floods.\n(vi) Need for Public Investment in Disaster Infrastructure\nGovernment is the biggest player who can invest in this infrastructure. Additional investment will help the government in ex-post measures for flood risk reduction. Public Partnership models need to be focused upon and developed for long-term strategic development.\nStrategy for Sustainable Organic Agriculture\n(i) Branding the default organic systems to Certified Organic having potential for domestic or export markets. This can be done at the government expense through APEDA. This can attract buyers for exports of its horticultural or crop produce. Mission mode approach to brand the Organic Brand from Bihar [trademark] for Litchi, mango, banana vegetables, makhana, etc. for urban domestic and export markets. Proper representation at domestic and foreign Organic Trade Shows should be immediately initiated and nurtured.\n(ii) A rapid action plan for converting the flood-prone districts to aquaculture through infrastructural development through private or contract farming operations. Functional clusters to be routed for processing operations for bulk marketing. Farm facilitators [NGOs or GO] can help to tie-up between the farmer clusters and the processor and subsequent exporter.\n(iii) Bihar Institute of Organic Agriculture (BIOA) can be set up in the state for training, certification, transferring technologies related to production, packaging, processing, and marketing. It may have a PPP for setting up a value chain. BIOA board should have participation of KVKs, Agricultural Universities, APEDA, DOA, and executives of certifying agencies.\n(iv) BIOA should advocate a package of practices for organic cultivation with technical help from Universities. The information should be made easily available to farmers by way of demonstration farms, training programs at Farmer’s Field day, and audio-visual aids. Promoting exposure visits of Bihar to other developed areas.\n(v) The program to set up soil testing laboratories can be mediated for developing Farm Facilitators through DOA and BIOA. These will further strengthen the development of semi-commercial inputs like compost brews, herbal extracts, parasitoids, predators, etc. State-level network projects through video conferencing can take technology to the farmer’s doorstep. Soil testing labs to be upgraded to test the residues of pesticides at the district level. Block-level farmer information and advisory centers being promoted under ATMA can be effectively linked to TOT prospects.\n(vi) Low-cost microbial seed dressing can be made compulsory on the lines of “Immunization to child” equivalent to “immunization for the seed”.\n(vii) Methods which destroy the much valuable soil organic matter like burning rice straw and sugarcane trash to be banned. Plough down approach together with economical “No-till” methods should be tested for feasibility.\n(viii) Soil Health Cards should be distributed to each farmer involving village panchayats. Bi-annual soil testing should be made\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
