However, it was observed to be negative when separately analyzed for the two sub-periods:\nFirst Sub-Period: Rate of decline was (-)1.01%\nSecond Sub-Period: Rate of decline was (-)0.20%\nWhen compared with the national average and those in the major potato-growing states, it was disappointingly low at:\n9.15 tonnes/ha in Bihar\n24.98 tonnes/ha in Gujarat\n22.09 tonnes/ha in West Bengal\n17.17 tonnes/ha in Uttar Pradesh\nThe national average was 13.51 tonnes/ha in 1990-93.\nRegional Pattern\nAlthough both production and area under potato were high in the north-west plains, in terms of yield, the:\nSouth-West Plains: 11.53 t/ha\nNorth-West: 9.91 t/ha\nEast Plains: 9.15 t/ha\nPlateau Zone: 7.87 t/ha\nshowed the following patterns:\nAcross different districts, it was significantly high at:\nNalanda: 18.03 t/ha\nBegusarai: 13.33 t/ha\nRohtas: 13.39 t/ha\nIt was impressively high in such districts as:\nDarbhanga: 12.70 t/ha\nGopalganj: 12.61 t/ha\nMadhubani: 12.77 t/ha\nSamastipur: 12.47 t/ha\nIn the north-west plains; and:\nPatna: 12.39 t/ha\nAurangabad: 10.44 t/ha\nNawadah: 10.59 t/ha\nIn the south-west plains.\nYield of potato did not vary much among the districts of the plateau zone, with yields ranging between:\n9.31 t/ha in Santhal Parganas\n7.39 t/ha in Giridih\nIV.9.13 Yield Trends by Region\nThe second sub-period brought:\nNorth-West Alluvial Plains: Reversal from declining (-2.10%) to increasing trend (1.10%).\nEast Alluvial Plains: Slackening in the increasing trend rate of growth from 3.58% in the first sub-period to 0.92% in the second sub-period.\nSouth-West Alluvial Plains: Continued to have a declining trend (-1.01%) even in the second sub-period.\nPlateau Districts: Recorded increasing trend in both sub-periods.\nAcross different districts, the rate of growth in yield of potato was relatively high in districts dominant in its production. These included:\nSamastipur: 6.63%\nBegusarai: 7.65%\nNalanda: 4.82%\nSome of the districts less dominant in potato production also showed relatively high rates of growth in yield. They included:\nDarbhanga: 8.75%\nGiridih: 3.90%\nPalamu: 6.22%\nIV.9.14 Conclusions\nThe foregoing discussion thus suggests the following broad conclusions on the trend and pattern of growth in potato cultivation in Bihar:\nPotato production in the State was only next to West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh in the country. It showed an increasing trend in Bihar but at a lower rate than in West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh.\nMuch of the increase in potato production was due to area expansion, as yield showed a declining trend.\nProduction of potato was not region-specific in the State, as it was being cultivated in significant measure in most of the districts in different agro-climatic zones of the state.\nDistricts growing potato dominantly showed relatively more impressive performance in potato production, especially in the second sub-period.\nWhile in most of the districts both area and yield of potato showed an increase, the districts of the south-west plains showed a reversal in potato output due largely to the decline in the yield rate.\nDistricts of the south-west plains were dominant in potato production but showed a reversal in yield.\nTables\nTable IV.9.1: Area, Production, and Yield of Potato in Bihar during 1971-93\nTable IV.9.2: Compound Annual Rate of Growth (%)\nFigures in parentheses indicate the level of significance.\n\nIV.10 CHILLIES\nThe crop group of spices and condiments grown in Bihar includes turmeric, coriander, chillies, ginger, and garlic. Chillies constituted a major share in terms of both area and production among these crops in Bihar. As much as 46.8% of the spices area and 47.8% of its production were under the chilli crop in the State in 1990-93. The following paragraphs examine the trend and pattern of growth in its production as well as area and yield over the years across different agro-climatic zones and districts in the State.\ni) Production\nThere was a sharp decline in chilli production in the state over these years. It was as high as 16.50 thousand tonnes in 1970-71, reaching a peak of 24.40 thousand tonnes in 1972-73. However, it started a nosedive thereafter, with the lowest level of production at 4.0 thousand tonnes in 1987-88. It, however, took an upward movement to reach 13.00 thousand tonnes in 1992-93. The trend rate of growth recorded a decline at (-)5.12% per annum during 1971-93. The rate of decline was (-)11.99% per annum in the second sub-period compared to (-)0.18% per annum in the first sub-period.
