The share of marginal holdings (less than 1 ha each) is as much as 82.9%. Marginal and small holdings account for about 59.8% of the total operated area.\nCrop Production and Yield\nIn terms of the value of output of major crops in Bihar (Rs.3017) is a shade lower than that of all India (Rs.3576). Rice and wheat are the major crops of kharif and rabi seasons, occupying nearly 3.7 and 2.1 million hectares, respectively. Maize is cultivated in about 4 and 5 lakh ha during kharif and rabi seasons, respectively. The average yield of the rice-wheat cropping system is 1.45 – 2.19 t/ha, against the production potential of 4.5 – 5 t/ha. Similarly, the average maize yield of the state is about 2.38 t/ha against its yield potential of 6 t/ha. Despite the state being rich in soil and water resources, the average yield of rice, wheat, and maize is only about 32%, 44%, and 40%, respectively, of the potential yield.\nThere is considerable scope to increase the productivity of rice, wheat, and maize in Bihar. The state has high potential for the development of horticulture, production, processing, post-harvest management, and marketing under the National Horticulture Mission, which operates in 16 districts of Bihar. The state also produces about 2.6 lakh tonnes of fish annually. There are about 2 lakh hectares of permanent water area and 1.2 lakh hectares of seasonal water area in the state. Besides, nearly 5 lakh hectares of paddy area are under deep water conditions, which can be well exploited for fisheries. The fisheries sector contributes nearly 1.85% of the state’s GSDP.\nEconomic Significance\nAgriculture is at the core of the state’s economy. The contribution of agriculture and its allied sectors to the state domestic product was 35 percent in 2007-08. Although this is a reduction from 48.5% in 1980, it remains among the highest in the country. During 1980-1992, agriculture and allied sectors in Bihar grew at 1.6 percent per annum compared to the national average of 3.1 percent. In fact, it was the lowest among most states. However, since 1993, growth in Bihar’s agricultural sector has accelerated. While the All India Agricultural GDP grew at 2.2 percent per annum between 1993-2003, the corresponding figure for Bihar was 2.7 percent, which was next only to West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh.\nChallenges and Opportunities\nFigures presented above adequately describe the poverty and low crop yields in Bihar. Hence, the goal of the agricultural production system is to maximize the income of land-owning and landless rural populace to improve their livelihood. This could be accomplished by increasing the income of the land-owning and landless rural population through increased production by enhancing productivity and intensity of farming and by generating more employment in agriculture and other rural-based production activities.\nSimultaneous care also needs to be taken to preserve the health of land, water, and other natural resources so that the agricultural production system remains ever productive and sustainable. The area under fallow land needs to be progressively reduced, providing assured irrigation and other services. Special attention is also needed for Tal, Diara, Chaur, and saline areas to augment production of crops, horticulture, fisheries, and other commodities.\nAgro-Ecological Situation\nAgriculture in Bihar benefits from a favorable agro-ecological situation for the production of various field and vegetable crops, fruits, livestock, fish, honey, and other commodities. Bihar enjoys a monopoly in the production of litchi and makhana in the country, followed by honey and aromatic and medicinal plants. The annual average rainfall in the state ranges from 1100 mm to 1400 mm in different agro-climatic zones.\nBesides a vast potential for surface irrigation, the state has utilized groundwater aquifers for irrigation purposes, covering about 43.47 lakh ha, which is only half of the exploitable groundwater potential for irrigation. North Bihar, constituting 56% of the state’s area, is risk-prone, and about one-third of the area is normally affected by floods every year. Nearly 10 lakh ha of land suffers from water stagnation for three to four months.\nIn 2007, about 215 lakh people in twenty-one districts were adversely affected by floods, and crops on an estimated area of 17 lakh ha were destroyed due to this natural disaster. In 2008, the unprecedented flood of Kosi created havoc in more than 14 districts, destroying kharif crops and assets worth Rs.100 billion, and a large number of laborers migrated out due to uncertainties of employment in agricultural activities.\nBesides, Tal and Diara areas are spread over 12.5 lakh hectares, accounting for 20% of agricultural land in Bihar. The specific land situation is dominated by mono cropping and has specific problems of land, water, and crop management. In pulses production, there is ample opportunity, but the area under pulses declined by three lakh hectares during the last 15 years, and pulse productivity remained stagnant during the last 10 years. Despite comparatively higher net profit in pulses production compared to wheat production, farmers prefer to cultivate wheat due to lower risk. Moreover, there is a dearth of promising and pest-disease-resistant varieties of pulses in Bihar. Maize is the only crop that has performed well in Bihar, particularly the introduced winter maize. Winter maize is produced mainly for market purposes, though price fluctuations are common.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
