The former reflects the focus on calorie sufficiency, which was the goal of the Green Revolution (GR), while the latter reflects the goal of nutrition security. GR policies crowded out nutrient-dense, non-staple crops, like coarse cereals and pulses. A “crop-neutral policy” that incentivizes the diversification of agricultural production toward non-staples is now needed.\nDuring the last few years, production of hybrid corn in Bihar increased, much of which is sent outside the state. In many parts of north Bihar, fisheries and Makhana cultivation increased in areas with large numbers of bodies of water. Fisheries, small ruminants, dairy, and poultry have immense potential for growth in Bihar. JEEViKA can play a catalyzing role in transforming the agriculture and food sectors in Bihar with help from the Departments of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and Fisheries, and major food-based companies with significant interests and presence in the state, like ITC, Ruchi Soya, and Godrej Agrovet. International agencies like HarvestPlus can play an important role in scaling up production of biofortified crops.\nThe producer response to increasing production of non-staples has been low, even though non-staple prices are higher than those of cereals. Incentives for production remain in favor of rice and wheat, and markets for non-staples are poorly developed, following the abolition of the APMCs in Bihar and the limited presence of private sector players. Therefore, diversification of agricultural production will require a structuring of incentives like subsidies for inputs and investments in markets, credit, and input infrastructure. The Department of Industries can encourage investments in the food processing industry in specific crop-based production clusters of the state, while FPOs (formed by JEEViKA) or cooperatives can help aggregate produce that can be directed toward such clusters. The JEEViKA Special Purpose Vehicle for Agriculture Transformation (JSPVAT) could help catalyze the process and accelerate the learning curve. A massive investment in the procurement infrastructure for non-staples is needed from the government, as well as remunerative MSPs. Such steps would indicate a convergence in the objectives of the Ministries of Agriculture and Consumer Affairs.\nImproving the Supply of Diverse, Micronutrient-Rich Foods in Safety-Net Programs\nA convergence of the objectives of diversification of agricultural production providing diversified, nutritious foods through the state’s food safety nets is imperative. Existing government food-based programs offer an opportunity for supplying micronutrient-rich foods to the most vulnerable sections of the population—pregnant and lactating mothers, infants and young children, and the poorest households in the state. The range of foods provided through programs like MDM, ICDS, and PDS can be diversified in connection with the diversification of agricultural production, reflecting the change in focus from calories to nutrient sufficiency. Diversification will entail pulses and coarse cereals in the case of the PDS and the inclusion of these, plus vegetables and animal-sourced foods, in the case of the MDM and ICDS. Similar to the child-feeding programs, the government should also consider providing biofortified crops, like high-zinc rice and wheat, high-iron pulses, and orange-fleshed sweet potato, through the PDS. Efforts should be made to provide maximum coverage to all vulnerable segments of the population in all the food safety-net programs, including migrants who have returned home after the COVID-19 crisis and their families.\nAn increase in the supply of micronutrient-rich foods through the ICDS and MDM programs, as well as in the PDS, can be achieved when similar goals are reflected in the activities of other government departments and programs. The Department of Women and Child Development and the Department of Education can increase their cost allocations per child for the Anganwadi and school feeding programs. The enhanced allocation can be used to procure an increased quota of micronutrient-rich non-staples by ensuring coordination with other relevant stakeholders. For instance, milk fortified with vitamin A and vitamin D could be supplied in collaboration with Sudha Dairy. The Departments of Agriculture and of Animal Husbandry and Fisheries can provide technical support to the existing JEEViKA groups in their efforts to diversify their farming systems to include vegetables and fisheries. Biofortified crops could also be grown through the JEEViKA groups and supplied to Anganwadi, schools, and the PDS program. Take Home Rations (THR), prepared and supplied by JEEViKA groups to the Anganwadi, could be scaled up under appropriate food safety regulations for locally processed food.\n\n8.2 Use of Locally Produced and Procured Material\nThe use of locally produced and procured material\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MDMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A government food-based program aimed at improving nutritional status)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ICDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Integrated Child Development Services, a government program focusing on child health and nutrition)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL HEALTH MISSION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A program aimed at improving health care delivery across India)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL FOOD SECURITY ACT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An act aimed at achieving food security in India)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India where nutrition security is being targeted through various programs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREEN REVOLUTION<|>EVENT<|>A period focusing on increasing agricultural production through high-yield crop varieties and intensive farming practices)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JEEVIKA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A program in Bihar that plays a catalyzing role in transforming agriculture and food sectors)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A department responsible for agricultural policies and programs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEPARTMENT OF ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND FISHERIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A department focused on the development of animal husbandry and fisheries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ITC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A major food-based company with significant interests and presence in Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUCHI SOYA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A food-based company involved in the agricultural sector in Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GODREJ AGROVET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A diversified agribusiness company involved in Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARVESTPLUS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An international agency involved in scaling up production of biofortified crops)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A department that encourages investments in the food processing industry)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FPOS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Farmer Producer Organizations, formed by JEEViKA to help aggregate produce)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JEEVIKA SPECIAL PURPOSE VEHICLE FOR AGRICULTURE TRANSFORMATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An entity created to catalyze agricultural transformation in Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEPARTMENT OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A department focusing on programs for women and children)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A department responsible for educational policies and programs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUDHA DAIRY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A dairy company collaborating to supply fortified milk)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JEEVIKA<|>DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE<|>JEEViKA collaborates with the Department of Agriculture to transform agriculture in Bihar<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JEEVIKA<|>DEPARTMENT OF ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND FISHERIES<|>JEEViKA works with the Department of Animal Husbandry and Fisheries to promote fisheries and livestock<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JEEVIKA<|>ITC<|>JEEViKA interacts with ITC for agricultural and food sector development in Bihar<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JEEVIKA<|>RUCHI SOYA<|>JEEViKA is involved with Ruchi Soya for the agricultural sector's growth<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JEEVIKA<|>GODREJ AGROVET<|>JEEViKA and Godrej Agrovet collaborate for agricultural development<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JEEVIKA<|>HARVESTPLUS<|>JEEViKA and HarvestPlus work together to increase biofortified crop production<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIES<|>FPOS<|>The Department of Industries supports FPOs for agricultural produce aggregation<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEPARTMENT OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT<|>SUDHA DAIRY<|>The department collaborates with Sudha Dairy to supply fortified milk<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
