The growth rate during 1984-93 in Bihar was comparable to agriculturally developed states like Punjab and Haryana, but lagged behind West Bengal.\nThe increase in foodgrains production was primarily due to rabi foodgrains, as kharif foodgrains production continued to stagnate, similar to the national trend.\nBoth area and yield contributed to the increase in rabi foodgrains production during the late eighties.\nThe impact of yield on kharif foodgrains production growth was less impressive compared to rabi foodgrains, and the area under kharif crops showed a shrinking trend.\nRabi foodgrains performance improved due to increased yield in Bihar, though it was still less compared to Punjab, Haryana, and West Bengal.\nThe south-west plains, followed by the north-west plains, were the main centers of foodgrains production in the state. Districts like Purnea, Rohtas, and Bhojpur had a high share in state foodgrains production.\nZones with dominant shares in foodgrains production also showed high growth rates. However, at the district level, the scenario was different, with districts having lower shares in production also showing relatively high growth rates.\nGrowth in foodgrains production was stable across different zones/districts, with a low coefficient of variation in the rate of growth. Acceleration in the rate of growth was observed across zones/districts, though there was a concerning acceleration in the declining trend in plateau districts.\nThe rate of increase in foodgrains yield in Bihar was not comparable to states like Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh. However, yield levels in some districts, especially in the south-west plains (e.g., Nalanda, Bhojpur, Patna), compared favorably with other major states.\nWith stagnant irrigation, inputs like fertilizer and HYV seeds played a more significant role in the accelerated growth process in Bihar agriculture.\n\nTables\nTable III.1\nArea, Production, and Yield as well as Trend Growth Rates in Foodgrains Production During 1971-93\nMoving average of 3 years ending.\nTable III.2\nCompound Annual Rate of Growth\nFigures in parentheses indicate the level of significance.\nTable III.3\nArea, Production, and Yield of Foodgrains in Kharif and Rabi Seasons in Major States ('000 tons)\nSource: Performance of Agriculture, May 1994, CMIE.

Production varied from 30.65 lakh tonnes (1982-83) to 56.35 lakh tonnes (1980-81).\nSecond Sub-Period (1983-91): Production showed a significant increase from around 50.0 lakh tonnes (1983-84) to 65.64 lakh tonnes (1990-91), with a growth rate of 2.59% per annum. However, production fell to 44.60 lakh tonnes (1991-92) and 35.69 lakh tonnes (1992-93) due to low rainfall.\nComparative Analysis:\nState Rank (1990-93): Bihar ranked seventh in paddy production with 48.64 lakh tonnes, despite having the second-highest area under paddy.\nProduction Comparison: Bihar's paddy production was 2.34 times lower than West Bengal and 2.00 times lower than Uttar Pradesh, largely due to lower yield levels. In Andhra Pradesh, the yield was 140% higher than in Bihar.\nRegional Pattern (1988-91):\nSouth-West Plains: Produced the most paddy (13.29 lakh tonnes) with relatively less area (8.39 lakh hectares), contributing 33% of state production.\nDistrict Contribution: Rohtas (7.40%), Gaya (6.22%), and Bhojpur (5.55%) led in paddy production. In the plateau region, Santhal Parganas (7.27%) and Ranchi (6.24%) were major contributors.\nTrend Growth Rates (1977-91):\nNorth-West Alluvial Plains: 0.27%\nSouth-West Alluvial Plains: 0.75%\nEast Alluvial Plains: -0.50%\nPlateau Districts: -2.03% (highest decline)\nGrowth Trends by Sub-Periods:\nFirst Sub-Period: Declining trends in all zones, with the highest decline in plateau districts (-13.51%) and lowest in North-West Alluvial Plains (-7.82%).\nSecond Sub-Period: Recovery with increasing trends in all zones, highest in South-West Alluvial Plains (7.09%) and lowest in Plateau Districts (1.77%).\nDistrict Performance (1977-91):\nHigh Growth Rates: Gopalganj (2.94%), Siwan (5.41%), Begusarai (6.58%)\nOther Notable Districts: Saran (2.48%), Nalanda (1.98%)\nii) Area Under Paddy\nTrends:\n1971-93: Minimum area was 43.83 lakh ha. (1992-93) and maximum was 55.89 lakh ha. (1977-78).
