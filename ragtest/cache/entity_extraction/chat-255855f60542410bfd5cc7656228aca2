In the east plains, only Katihar showed a decline in yield (-3.83%), while other districts showed increases ranging from 3.38% to 0.14%, with Purnea, Munger, and Saharsa gaining relatively more. In the south-west plains, all districts showed an increasing trend in yield, ranging from 3.33% to 1.45%. The plateau zone districts showed impressive increases in autumn paddy yield, ranging from 7.67% to 1.40%, with Palamu showing a significant increase of 7.67%. Singhbhum was the only district in this zone to show a decline at (-)1.01%.\nIV.1.35\nFor winter paddy, most districts showed an increase in yield. Notable performers included Madhubani (5.92%) and Siwan (5.12%) in the north-west; Munger (4.91%) in the east plains; Bhojpur (4.03%) and Nalanda (3.97%) in the south-west; and Hazaribagh (2.40%) and Giridih (2.35%) in the plateau zone. Declines in yield were observed in Muzaffarpur (-0.62%) and Samastipur (-1.78%) in the north-west; Saharsa (-0.63%) in the east; and Palamu (-0.99%) in the plateau zone.\nIV.1.36\nYield levels for summer paddy increased in most districts across all agro-climatic zones. Impressive performances were noted in West Champaran (6.62%) and Saran (5.64%) in the north-west; Bhagalpur (6.00%) and Katihar (5.34%) in the east; Rohtas (4.47%) in the south-west; and Singhbhum (3.25%) and Santhal Parganas (3.98%) in the plateau zone. However, districts like Begusarai (-2.31%) in the east; Bhojpur (-1.38%), Gaya (-0.14%), and Patna (-2.66%) in the south-west; and Giridih (-1.25%), Ranchi (-2.52%), and Dhanbad (-0.74%) in the plateau zone showed a declining trend.\nConclusions\nIV.1.37\nThe following broad conclusions can be drawn:\nGrowth Rate: Paddy production grew at 1.19% during 1971-93, with significant fluctuations year to year. The second sub-period saw more growth, but the State lagged behind other major States in terms of production, ranking second in area and seventh in production.\nProduction Distribution: The south-west plains, covering 24.42% of the area, contributed 33.0% of the paddy production. Districts with higher production included Rohtas, Bhojpur, Santhal Parganas, Ranchi, East Champaran, West Champaran, and Purnea.\nTrend Analysis: All zones showed a declining trend in the first sub-period but an increasing trend in the second sub-period. The east plains exhibited higher growth rates, with districts such as Saran, Siwan, Munger, Nalanda, Nawadah, and Palamu showing significant growth.\nArea and Yield: The increase in paddy production was primarily due to yield improvements, as the area under paddy shrank. The rate of area shrinkage was similar across zones at around 2.0% to 3.0% per annum during 1977-91. Districts with high area shrinkage included Madhubani, Sitamarhi, Vaishali, West Champaran, Purnea, Patna, Bhojpur, Santhal Parganas, and Singhbhum, while Begusarai and Siwan showed area expansion.\nYield Performance: Yield performance improved notably, especially in the second sub-period (2.32%). Despite this, it lagged behind other paddy-growing States. The north-west and south-west plains showed more impressive yield increases. Madhubani and Munger were prominent for rate of yield increase, while the south-west plains showed high yield levels with districts like Nalanda, Bhojpur, and Patna leading.\nSeasonality: Winter paddy was dominant in area and production, but summer paddy exhibited higher yield levels. Autumn and summer paddy showed more impressive increases than winter paddy. Autumn and summer paddy areas increased, while winter paddy areas declined. Summer and autumn paddy also showed better yield growth compared to winter paddy.\nGeographical Distribution: Winter paddy was cultivated uniformly across different zones, while summer paddy cultivation was more area-specific in the east plains. The north-west dominated in autumn paddy production, and Ranchi in the plateau zone led in autumn paddy area and production, along with districts like East Champaran, Gopalganj, West Champaran, and Purnea.\n\n\nTable IV.1.1: Area, Production, and Yield of Paddy, and Trend Growth Rates (1971-1993)\nNote: Area and production figures are 3-year moving averages.\nTable IV.1.2: Compound Annual Rate of Growth (CARG)\nFigures in parentheses indicate the level of significance.\nTable IV.1.3: Year-wise Area, Production, and Yield of Paddy in Different Seasons\nNote: Significant at 5.0% level.\n\nMaize Data\ni) Production of Maize\nTable IV.2.1: Production of Maize (1971-93)\nMaize production remained relatively stagnant until\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
