Incidentally, the latter two zones are also the zones with the lowest rainfall among all the regions of the State. Thus, while the importance of canal irrigation is much greater in the southern parts of Bihar (Zone 3), there is an almost exclusive reliance on tubewell irrigation in the northern parts, especially in Zone 2. This is rather peculiar as most of the rivers in Bihar flow through its northern plains, which therefore should have had a better canal irrigation capacity.\nMinor and micro irrigation have only a limited coverage in the overall irrigation scenario of the State, accounting for only 7.53 percent of the irrigated area. Here too, there is a great deal of variation in its use across the State. While only 2 percent of the irrigated area of Zone 2 has minor irrigation as its source, its contribution to irrigated area in Zone 3 is around 17 percent.\nGroundwater resources have remained largely unutilized in the State. To tap the huge potential of groundwater irrigation, the Million Shallow Tubewell Programme has been prepared, which would imply additional irrigation capacity of 20 lakh hectares. About 6.97 lakh diesel tubewells and pumpsets are to be distributed by March 2007 under this programme. Farmers are given a grant of 30 percent and a loan of 50 percent of total costs under this Programme, and no discrimination is made between different categories of beneficiary farmers. Against the distribution target of 5.37 lakh pumpsets by March 2006, 3.80 lakh pumpsets were distributed by November 2005.\nOn-farm water management programme is being run in all the 38 districts of the State, under which shallow pumpsets, normal pumpsets, and other micro irrigation sources are being arranged. Watershed development programme is being run under which water-generating ponds and other devices of groundwater regeneration are being constructed to develop and improve water utilization capacity in the State. In this direction, 5 lakh trees have been planted in 8 districts of the State under the agro-forestry programme towards developing water utilization capacity. Sprinkler sets and HDPIP pipes are being distributed in the State under the Centrally sponsored ISOPOM plan for the production of pulses, oilseeds, and maize. By March 2006, additional irrigation capacity of 18,000 hectares of land was created under this programme. Against the target to create additional irrigation capacity of 2.39 lakh hectares in 2006-07, an additional irrigation capacity of 1.76 lakh hectares was created by September 2006. In the 10th Plan, the actual outlay on irrigation was Rs 1980 crore, which was only about 60 percent of the total agreed outlay on irrigation (Table 2.13). A substantial portion of this outlay was on major and medium irrigation.\n2.6 Agricultural Inputs\nSeeds\nAgriculture in Bihar has been bedeviled by a trend of falling productivity over the last few years. Major crops, particularly rice and wheat, which together account for 77.26 percent of the total cropped area, have seen a substantive fall in their productivity in recent years. Falling productivity of the agricultural sector in Bihar, despite its rich soil endowment, can be partly explained by the limited availability of good quality seed and a very poor seed replacement rate.\nSeed replacement rate for cereals is about 10-12 percent, for gram it is 7.5 percent, and for rapeseed and mustard, it is 30 percent (Table 2.14). The seed replacement ratio for paddy has increased from 6.8 percent in 2003-04 to 10 percent in 2004-05 to 12 percent in 2005-06. This ratio for wheat was 10 percent in 2004-05 and 11 percent in 2005-06. These rates are much below the desirable 30-35 percent for self-pollinated crops and 50 percent for cross-pollinated crops. In other states, the seed replacement for paddy is at 50 percent in Andhra Pradesh, the rate for wheat is 41 percent in Maharashtra, for gram it is 30 percent in Orissa, and for rapeseed and mustard, it is 100 percent in Gujarat. However, the seed replacement ratios for oilseeds and maize in the State meet the desired norms, standing at 30 percent for rapeseeds and mustard, and 40 percent for rabi maize, which is reflected in their yield being above the national average.\n\n \n    \n \nSeed Replacement Rate and Seed Consumption\nSeed Replacement Rate (2006)\nThe target seed replacement rate for pulses in 2006 was 14 percent for kharif and 10 percent for rabi seasons respectively. The seed replacement target for oilseeds and vegetables was 30 percent and 60 percent respectively. There has been an increase in seed consumption of paddy and wheat in the State in recent years. While seed consumption for paddy has increased sharply from 72.26 thousand quintals in 2001-02 to 194.25 thousand quintals in 2005-06, the same for wheat has increased moderately from 190.64 thousand quintals to 237.85 thousand quintals over the same period (Table 2.15). This increase in seed consumption in the backdrop of their falling acreage is explained by an increase in seed replacement ratio and increasing use of HYVs for these crops. The acreage of paddy under HYVs has increased by almost 4 percent over the period 1999-2005, and that of wheat under HYVs has increased by around 2 percent over the same\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
