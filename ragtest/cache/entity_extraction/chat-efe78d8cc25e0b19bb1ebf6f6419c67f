Similarly, crops with high irrigation showed higher coverage of HYVs. Again, the association between fertilizer consumption and coverage of HYVs was strong.\nxxiv) Given the yield augmenting effect of HYVs, farmers of Bihar do not seem to wait for irrigation for its use, as HYV area was observed to show high positive elasticity even in districts with low irrigation network, including plateau districts.\nFlow of Institutional Credit\nxxv) The gap between the credit requirements, as estimated by the Sen Committee/Task Force/Potential Linked Credit Plan, and the actual flow of credit has been wide in the State such that not even 50% of the estimated credit requirements was being disbursed.\nxxvi) Compared to other major states, the flow of credit in the State was much less. While it was as high as Rs. 5,961 per hectare in Kerala, Rs. 5,155 in Tamil Nadu and Rs. 1,189 in Punjab, it was just Rs. 312 in Bihar in 1992-93.\nxxvii) The share of agriculture in the total credit flow was high at 67.6% in 1992-93 in the State. However, it showed wide year-to-year fluctuation which may be causing uncertainty in the use of modern inputs.\nxxviii) Role of co-operative credit has reached dwindling level with their share reaching an almost negligible proportion.\nxxix) With co-operatives and Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) assuming back seat, the commercial banks alone are playing active role in credit dispensation in the state. However, their involvement remains unbalanced, as advances are remaining stagnant while deposits are increasing.\nxxx) District-wise analysis of credit flows clearly suggested that agriculturally more prosperous zones/districts got higher share of credit. It was evident from the relationship between share of the district in total foodgrains production and credit flows in the State.\nxxxi) Zonal/Regional biasness in the flow of credit was not reflected in the State. The plateau zone had almost similar share in total credit flows as in other zones. Some of the districts in the plateau zone showed much higher flow of credit per hectare than those in the plain land.\nxxxii) Mounting overdues have become endemic for the State with recovery level as low as 5.0% for PACS and 20.0% for BSLDB. Although commercial banks showed relatively better recovery performance at around 55.0%, it was not as good as in states like Haryana, Punjab and Kerala.\nOperational Holdings and Tenancy Status\ni) Number of operational holdings was increasing in the state thereby reducing the average size of holding and making them operationally non-viable. The total area under operational holding, on the other hand, was declining.\nii) The increasing numerical strength of marginal and small farmers was relatively high in Bihar (86.70%) compared to the national average (76.20%). The problem was further compounded by increasing sub-divisions and fragmentations.\niii) Although number of large farmers and area operated by them showed sharp decline, the fact that large farmers forming only 0.6% owned 10.5% of the total operational land indicates the continuation of skewed land distribution in the State.\niv) Concentration of land was district-specific with Purnea, Gaya and Muzaffarpur leading among them. The same districts showed fast increase in the number of operational holdings as well.\nv) Land possession rate as well as land distribution rate was relatively low in Bihar as compared to other major states. According to studies, the declared surplus land in the State (158.0 thousand ha.) was also observed to be much less than the estimated surplus land (731.0 thousand ha.).\nvi) Operational holdings are also highly fragmented with an average of 17-20 parcels. This must have hindered diffusion of modern technology and restricted application of mechanical mode.\nvii) Despite prohibition of tenancy cultivation under Bihar Tenancy Act, the incidence of concealed tenancy was high at around 60% in the State. The form of tenancy was largely oral in the State to escape the law. The dominant form of oral tenancy was share cropping (97%) with fixed share in produce as rent. Under such tenancy, according to studies, while the sharecropper was left with a net return of 15%, the return to the landowner after deducting cost of land revenue and input costs worked out at around 35.0%.\nviii) Despite sharing the input costs, the use of modern inputs was less in the case of sharecroppers, resulting in lower productivity. This was largely due to insecurity attached to tenancy cultivation.\n\nAbsentee Cultivation\nix) The menace of absentee cultivation was equally high in the State, estimated at around 16.6 lakh hectares, which accounts for about 25.0% of tenant holdings. This segment of land was out of the gamut of any investment as the sharecropper did not have the surplus nor could they obtain credit support due to security norms. The landowner was also not interested in investing in these pieces of land.\nPolicy Conclusions\n30) The study revealed that foodgrains production in Bihar has recently accelerated and is on a stable growth path. However, considering the per capita availability of foodgrains and the State’s climatically favorable conditions, the production can’t be deemed adequate. For example, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh, with almost equal areas, produced double the paddy output compared to Bihar. Similarly, Haryana produced almost the same level of wheat as Bihar with half the area. Non-food crops also show poor performance with relatively low area and yield. The primary issues in the foodgrains sector are low yield and shrinking area, while non-food crops suffer from low yield, low area, and largely unirrigated conditions\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
