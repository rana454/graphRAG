The growth in output is not commensurate with the increased fertilizer use as also observed at the all-India level, as reflected in the study by Parikh and Srinivasan (1974). Significantly, agriculture of Bihar has been responsive to increased use of chemical fertilizers and its resultant impact on enhanced crop yield. Fertilizer consumption in Bihar was a mere 9.06 kg/ha. in 1970-71 which increased to 21.01 kg/ha. in 1982-83 and to a high of 57.20 kg/ha. in 1992-93, recording a compound annual growth rate of 8.73% during 1971-93. Despite such an impressive jump in the use of chemical fertilizers, the State was not nearer to the level of fertilizer consumption in states like Punjab (162.2 kg/ha.), Haryana (107.8 kg/ha.), Uttar Pradesh (86.0 kg/ha.), Tamil Nadu (117.1 kg/ha.), as also the all-India average (67.1 kg/ha.) in 1992-93.\nRegional Analysis\nVIII.4 Fertilizer consumption was increasing in different agro-climatic zones/districts as well. However, there was wide variation in the level of its use across different zones/districts. It was as high as 87.36 kg/ha. in the south-west plains, followed by 55.04 kg/ha. in the north-west and 50.11 kg/ha. in the east plains during 1990-91. On the other hand, it was much less at 25.66 kg/ha. in the plateau zone. Across different districts, the fertilizer consumption was as high as 135.86 kg/ha. in Nalanda and 103.62 kg/ha. in Begusarai. The levels of fertilizer consumption in these districts were almost similar to that of Punjab, Haryana, and other agriculturally developed states. Among the districts of the north-west plains, the fertilizer consumption was relatively high in Saran (81.80 kg/ha.), Muzaffarpur (79.35 kg/ha.), Vaishali (73.43 kg/ha.), and Samastipur (68.92 kg/ha.). On the other hand, districts such as Madhubani (18.85 kg/ha.) and Darbhanga (33.93 kg/ha.) showed relatively low consumption of fertilizers.\nVIII.5 The districts in the east plains did not present an encouraging picture in the use of fertilizers. Among these districts, however, Purnea (59.68 kg/ha.) and Katihar (59.74 kg/ha.) showed relatively high levels of fertilizer consumption. Bhagalpur (30.66 kg/ha.) and Saharsa (34.25 kg/ha.) lagged far behind. Increase in the consumption of fertilizer was relatively more in Purnea and Katihar, growing annually at 20.96% and 23.87% respectively during 1977-91. Bhagalpur and Munger, on the other hand, showed stagnation in the consumption of fertilizer, especially during the second sub-period.\nVIII.6 Fertilizer consumption in the districts of the plateau zone was less than 25 kg/ha. Dhanbad (4.86 kg/ha.) and Palamu (10.24 kg/ha.) showed the least consumption of fertilizers. With the exception of Dhanbad, the districts of this zone, however, showed an increasing trend in its consumption during 1977-91.\nComposition of Fertilizer Consumption\nVIII.7 The composition of chemical fertilizer is important, as it adversely affects soil fertility if used disproportionately. It is important, therefore, to use fertilizers in required doses as well as in optimum composition. In Bihar, fertilizer was used largely for paddy and wheat. Comparing the recommended dose of chemical fertilizer for these crops with that of the actual consumption, it is observed that the use of fertilizer nutrients was not balanced in the state. As against the recommended share of 56.0% for nitrogen, it was 74.0% in 1970-71. Although, over the years, the share of nitrogen declined from 80.0% in 1975-76 to 67.5% in 1992-93, still it remained excess to the recommended level. The consumption of phosphorus, on the other hand, was deficient despite its increasing share over the years from 16.0% in 1970-71 to 22.5% in 1992-93 as against the recommended composition of 30%. The use of potash as well was deficient and remained at around 10.0% only as against the recommended composition of 14%. Thus, while nitrogen was over-used, the use of potash and phosphorus was deficient in the state.\n\nVIII. Fertilizer Consumption and Composition in Bihar\nVIII.1 Fertilizer Consumption Across Agro-Climatic Zones\nThe level of fertilizer consumption varied significantly across different agro-climatic zones in Bihar. The consumption was as high as 87.36 kg/ha in the south-west plains, followed by 55.04 kg/ha in the north-west and 50.11 kg/ha in the east plains during 1990-91. In contrast, the plateau zone had much lower consumption at 25.66 kg/ha.\nAmong districts, fertilizer consumption\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India that has seen a significant increase in fertilizer consumption over the years, but still lags behind other states like Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu in terms of per hectare fertilizer use)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUNJAB<|>GEO<|>An Indian state known for high levels of fertilizer consumption, indicative of its developed agricultural sector)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARYANA<|>GEO<|>An Indian state with high fertilizer consumption per hectare, reflecting its agricultural development)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UTTAR PRADESH<|>GEO<|>An Indian state with significant fertilizer consumption, showcasing its agricultural activity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAMIL NADU<|>GEO<|>An Indian state with notable fertilizer consumption, indicating its agricultural productivity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NALANDA<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar with one of the highest fertilizer consumption rates, comparable to agriculturally developed states)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEGUSARAI<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar known for its high fertilizer consumption, on par with some of the most agriculturally developed states)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SARAN<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar with relatively high fertilizer consumption within the state)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUZAFFARPUR<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar noted for its significant fertilizer consumption)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VAISHALI<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar with considerable fertilizer consumption)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMASTIPUR<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar with high levels of fertilizer consumption)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MADHUBANI<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar with low fertilizer consumption compared to other districts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DARBHANGA<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar with relatively low fertilizer consumption)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PURNIA<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar that showed a significant increase in fertilizer consumption, indicating a focus on agricultural development)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KATIHAR<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar with high fertilizer consumption, reflecting its agricultural activity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BHAGALPUR<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar with stagnant fertilizer consumption, indicating potential issues in agricultural development)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAHARSA<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar with low fertilizer consumption, suggesting limited agricultural development)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DHANBAD<|>GEO<|>A district in the plateau zone of Bihar with the least fertilizer consumption, indicating minimal agricultural activity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PALAMU<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar's plateau zone with very low fertilizer consumption, reflecting minimal agricultural development)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>PUNJAB<|>Bihar's fertilizer consumption is compared to Punjab to highlight the difference in agricultural development<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>HARYANA<|>Bihar's fertilizer consumption is compared to Haryana, indicating a gap in agricultural productivity<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>UTTAR PRADESH<|>Bihar's fertilizer consumption is contrasted with Uttar Pradesh's to show differences in agricultural practices<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>TAMIL NADU<|>Bihar's fertilizer consumption is compared to Tamil Nadu's, showcasing disparities in agricultural development<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NALANDA<|>BEGUSARAI<|>Nalanda and Begusarai are both districts in Bihar with high fertilizer consumption, indicating similar agricultural intensities<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PURNIA<|>KATIHAR<|>Purnia and Katihar are districts with relatively high fertilizer consumption, suggesting focused agricultural development in these areas<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BHAGALPUR<|>SAHARSA<|>Bhagalpur and Saharsa both have low fertilizer consumption, indicating potential agricultural development issues<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DHANBAD<|>PALAMU<|>Dhanbad and Palamu are districts in the plateau zone with minimal fertilizer consumption, reflecting limited agricultural activity<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
