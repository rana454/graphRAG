There must be investment in BCC programs related to open defecation and ensuring the supply of contaminant-free, piped drinking water. WASH interventions are especially important in the flood-prone areas of north Bihar, where every year communities suffer due to the breakdown of water and sanitation infrastructure and the spread of waterborne diseases like cholera. Bihar must also ensure safe drinking water that is free of harmful microbes and excess arsenic, fluoride, and other heavy metals. Related agricultural issues, like the loss in quality of food during postharvest storage, can be addressed through the use of airtight bags. The Departments of Health and WCD can also address waterborne illnesses related to the nature of cropping practices, like standing in water during rice transplantation.\nSDG2 Goals Can Be Realized More Effectively If There Is Convergence in Policy Design and Implementation\nGiven that food systems comprise not just agricultural production, but also inputs, markets, women’s empowerment, and WASH, a convergence in the objectives and activities of the various government departments whose policies traditionally target a single aspect of the food system is needed. For policy convergence, the Bihar government must reach out to all stakeholders who have a role to play in transforming nutritional outcomes in the state, including various departments of the government, as well as development organizations, civil society bodies, and the private sector. Collaboration between stakeholders is needed at the start of the process, when policy objectives are conceptualized, all the way down to the implementation of activities on the ground. At the grassroots, there is a need for empowering village-level bodies like the village health sanitation and nutrition committees (VHSNCs) and village education committees (VECs) with key responsibilities ensuring the implementation of policies related to nutrition security.\nInvest in Better Data Systems\nGiven that the SDGs are interconnected in nature and related to the point of convergence in the policy schemes discussed here, there is a need for a unified database that can be used for evidence-based decision-making. The Global Sustainable Development Goals Report (GSDGR) states that “tracking progress on the SDGs requires the collection, processing, analysis and dissemination of an unprecedented amount of data and statistics at subnational, regional and global levels.” In this regard, the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI), together with NITI Aayog, has prepared a National Indicator Framework (NIF) that includes a list of 297 indicators to measure progress toward each of the 17 SDGs. Each state can adapt the NIF to its requirements. According to the Voluntary National Review (VNR), about 60 percent of states in the country have developed a state indicator framework, and just 30 percent have put into place a district indicator framework. Putting into place a mechanism for the collection of high-frequency data at the subnational level that can be disaggregated by characteristics like gender, caste, rural/urban, and so forth, will be critical for effectively monitoring progress toward achieving the SDGs.\nFor SDG2, specifically, the SDG India Index relies on the following indicators to track progress made by each state:\nRatio of rural households covered under PDS to rural households where monthly income of the highest earning member is less than INR 5,000\nPercentage of children under 5 who are stunted and underweight\nPercentage of pregnant women and children under 5 who are anemic\nRice, wheat, and coarse cereals produced annually (kg/ha)\nGross value-added (GVA) in agriculture per worker\nSome of these indicators can be made more sensitive to nutrition. For example, instead of including production of rice and wheat with coarse cereals, one could account for non-staples like pulses that are more nutrient-rich. Alternately, a composite measure of the nutrition diversity of a state’s agricultural production could be developed that accounts for not just crop production but also production and productivity in animal husbandry, horticulture, etc. Similarly, while the ratio of rural households covered under PDS reflects households that are vulnerable to food and nutrition insecurity, a sharper measure to reflect nutrition sensitivity might be the ratio of households that received key non-staples from the PDS or a composite measure that also brings in the ratio of women and children who benefit from the ICDS and MDM.\nOne of the biggest data gaps in India comes from the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO). The latest disaggregated data on food expenditures and prices is available for the year 2011 at best. Similarly, estimates around poverty rates and population rely on the census that is conducted every 10 years. Too much has likely changed in the following 10 years to base current and future policies on such old data. More frequent surveys are essential. A change in the indicators used to track food and nutrition in national surveys would also be helpful. For instance, the food groups considered by the National Family Health Survey should correspond to the FAO food groups so as to allow for international comparisons. Data on women’s empowerment should focus on indicators that are related to both agriculture and nutrition. In this respect, TCI–TARINA has led the way in designing, testing, and analyzing context-specific metrics, specifically around the role that women play in agriculture and its relation to nutritional outcomes for women and their families.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
