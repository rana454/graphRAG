Background\nBihar is an agrarian state, endowed with fertile land and hardworking farmers. Therefore, Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalam, the former President of India, called the agriculture sector the core competence of Bihar. Accelerated development of the agriculture sector in eastern states, especially Bihar, is crucial for the food security of the country, as highlighted by the National Commission on Farmers.\nCurrent Status of Agriculture\nThe current status of agriculture in the state can be understood based on land utilization statistics. According to the land utilization statistics for 2020-21:\n* Geographical Area: 9359.57 lakh hectares\n* Forest Area: 621.64 lakh hectares\n* Barren and Uncultivable Land: 431.72 lakh hectares\n* Non-Agricultural Land: 1750.74 lakh hectares\n* Agricultural Wasteland: 43.79 lakh hectares\n* Non-Agricultural Land (Other than Fallow): 264.76 lakh hectares\n* Fallow Land:\n   * Current Fallow: 1028.10 lakh hectares\n   * Other Fallow: 173.50 lakh hectares\n* Net Cropped Area: 50.45 lakh hectares\n* Gross Cropped Area: 72.46 lakh hectares\n* Cropping Intensity (%): 144%\nAccording to the Agriculture Census (2015-16), out of the total number of land holdings in the state, 91.21 percent are marginal holdings, with a holding size of less than 1 hectare.\nThe agriculture sector significantly contributes to the state's economy. According to the Bihar Economic Survey 2021-22, the contribution of the agriculture sector to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the state in 2020-21 was about 19 percent. Within the agriculture sector:\n* Crop Contribution: 9.3 percent\n* Livestock Contribution: 6.6 percent\n* Fisheries Contribution: 1.7 percent\nThe contribution of the agriculture sector at fixed prices in 2016-17 was Rs. 66,668 crore (21.7 percent of GDP), which increased to Rs. 74,086 crore in 2020-21 (19 percent of GDP). The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of agriculture sector's contribution to GSDP during 2016-17 to 2020-21 was 2.1 percent.\nAccording to the 2019 NSS report, \"Situation Assessment of Agricultural Households and Land and Livestock Holding of Households in Rural India,\" the average income of agricultural households in the state is Rs. 7,542, more than double compared to the year 2012-13. At the national level, the average income of agricultural households increased from Rs. 6,426 to Rs. 10,218 during the same period. Therefore, the rate of increase in income of agricultural households in Bihar has been higher than the national average.\nAs per the NSS report, 39.7 percent of agricultural households in Bihar are indebted, with a debt per agricultural household of Rs. 23,534, while at the national level, 50.2 percent of agricultural households are indebted, with a debt per agricultural household of Rs. 74,121.\nDevelopment Efforts and Achievements\nFor the optimal utilization of agricultural resources and the economic upliftment of farmers, the State Government has been consistently working on the development of the agriculture sector through the Agricultural Road Map since 2008. For the first time, \"Farmer\" was defined under the Agricultural Road Map for the sake of implementing schemes. According to this definition, \"Farmers\" includes landless agricultural laborers, sharecroppers, tenants, small, marginal, and sub-marginal cultivators, farmers with larger holdings, fishers, livestock and poultry rearers, pastoralists, small plantation farmers, as well as rural and tribal families engaged in various farming-related occupations such as apiculture, sericulture, and vermiculture. The term also includes tribal families sometimes engaged in shifting cultivation and the collection and use of non-timber forest products. Farm and Home Science graduates earning their livelihoods from crop and animal husbandry, fisheries, and agro-forestry are also considered part of the farming community. As a result, more than 1.90 crore farmers have been registered on the DBT portal of the Agriculture Department, including more than 68 lakh landless farmers.\nThe first three Agricultural Road Maps have been implemented by the state government with the resolve: \"A dish of Bihar in the plate of every Indian\" (Pratyek Bhartiya ke thal me Bihar ka ek vyanjan). Schemes were implemented for a qualitative increase in agricultural production and for strengthening and rejuvenating infrastructure to take agricultural produce from the state to the entire country.\nMajor Achievements of the Policies and Agricultural Road Map Programs\n* Krishi Karman Awards: The state has received five Krishi Karman Awards from the Government of India for its remarkable achievements in the production and productivity of:\n   * Rice in 2011-12\n   * Wheat in 2012-13\n   * Coarse cereals (Maize) in 2015-16\n   * Coarse cereals (Maize) in 2016-17\n   * Wheat in 2017-18\n* Productivity and Production Increases:\n   * The average productivity of wheat increased from 18.29 quintals per hectare (2003-04 to 2007-08) to 28.89 quintals per hectare (2017-18 to 2021-22). The average production of wheat increased from 37.97 lakh metric tonnes to 62.82 lakh metric tonnes during the same period.\n   * The average\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>An agrarian state in India with a significant contribution to the country's food security and a high percentage of marginal land holdings)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DR.
