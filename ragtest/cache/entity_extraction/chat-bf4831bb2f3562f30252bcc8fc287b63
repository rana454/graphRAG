Such a rich source of fixed carbon can be converted into wealth by mobilizing the bio-mass to feed the soil. About 1800 million tons of animal dung is produced annually in our country. Even if two-thirds of it is used for bio-gas generation, it is expected to yield a bio-gas of not less than 120 mm³ per day and manure of 440 million tons per year, which is equivalent to 2.9 mt of N, 2.75 mt of P₂O₅, and 1.89 mt of K₂O. As far as possible, organic farming systems are closed-loop cycles with respect to nutrient balance. Only nutrients exported are in the form of food for human and animal consumption. Crop burning is avoided. Unscientific storage and loss of nutrients are also avoided. Thus, organic agriculture is considered to conserve the micro-ecosystem and is more sustainable than conventional agriculture.\nSoil Health and Cost Reduction\nReducing the cost of cultivation is key for profitability. Farmers today are concerned with many aspects beyond production. They need safe inputs that provide relief from using toxic chemicals without compromising productivity. Earlier practices of clean cultivation aimed at preventing the growth of all types of life forms near plant surfaces, leading to unbalanced systems that increase the chances of pathogen colonization at alarming rates due to less or no competition from native flora. Such systems require extremely high quantities of inputs, leading farmers into a vicious cycle of persistent chemical input use, which increases production costs.\nOrganic Systems and Safe Inputs\nOrganic systems primarily aim at safe inputs at lower costs. Certain Do-it-Your-Own technologies, like preparing active microbial cultures on-farm, are used worldwide. These technologies are categorized under aerobic or anaerobic brewing. Effective Microorganisms, also known as “EM technology,” is a method to improve soil quality and plant growth using a mixture of microorganisms consisting mainly of lactic acid bacteria, purple bacteria, and yeasts that coexist for the benefit of the environment they are introduced into. Using inoculums concentrate, farmers can prepare EM solutions on-field at a minimal cost.\nAerobic Extraction of Microbes\nLately, aerobic extraction of microbes from composts is being tried worldwide. Compost teas, as they are called, show positive effects on foliar and soil applications. They increase the biodiversity of microbes, in addition to supplying useful soluble metabolites from composts. Another Indian technology, KREF Solution, is used by Indian farmers to aerobically brew and extract essential nutrients from vermin-compost enriched with useful nitrogen-fixing and phosphate-solubilizing microbes. KREF Biomanure contains total fermentation solids and soluble bacteria and fungi extracted from natural organic manure. These units can be set up in each village by a rural entrepreneur financed by cooperatives or banks.\nBrewing and Application of KREF Solution\nA specialized user-friendly brewing vessel is used to aerobically brew the microbes extracted from vermicompost and added specially using polymeric carbon sources. Such microbes are allowed to grow for 24 hours aerobically, and the resulting KREF solution is used at 20 liters per acre as foliar and soil application. Since the farmer brews it on his field, the costs are low and economical. The beneficial effects of such KREF solutions have been tested over 10,000 acres since 2005. On-farm brewing of microbes is economical. KREF is boosting the organic movement and grassroots level entrepreneurship.\nDynamic Blend of Microbes in KREF\nThe dynamic blend of microbes in KREF plays a key role during the process by extracting the locked-up nutrients from KREF Compost through their enzymatic characteristics. Naturally occurring fungi in the compost, such as Aspergillus, Paecilomyes, Penicillium, Chaetomium, Verticillium, and Trichoderma, secrete cellulases that decompose cellulosic residues into simpler carbohydrates. Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Chaetomium can also split hemicelluloses. Amylases, which decompose starch, are secreted by almost all KREF manure microbes. Key amylase producers include Aspergillus and Bacillus, which grow profusely and exhibit attributes like solubilization of insoluble phosphate and nucleic acids degradation. The enzymatic abilities of these organisms enable them to utilize carbon sources efficiently, bringing nutrients into the food or nutrient cycle for utilization by other microbes. The fermentation cycle results in the thorough extraction of nutrients and microbes from the compost. KREF Biomanure microbes, being highly competitive, enrich the end product (brew) in terms of nutrients and microbes. The fungi showing antagonistic abilities, such as Trichoderma, Aspergillus, and Chaetomium, secrete chitinases that restrict the growth of unwanted fungi. The yeast Saccharomyces grows competitively during aeration at all levels of dissolved oxygen, helping to keep anaerobic bacteria growth in check after preparation during storage. The process cycle of 24 hours enables the extraction of a diverse range of microbes, including actinomycetes, fungi, bacteria, and protozoa, from the KREF Compost.\nPost-Fermentation Use for Soil and Foliar Application\nAfter reaching soil or leaves, microbes function in the following ways:\nAid in Nutrient Cycling: Microbes are responsible for setting the wheels of the organic food chain rolling. Their secretive, enzymatic abilities canalize the available food into the food web, creating a buffer for absorbing stress and coordinating the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
