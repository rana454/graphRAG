Rapeseed and mustard are the major oilseeds crops in the state followed by linseed which is generally used as the cooking medium. The crop is grown in all the 38 districts and the produce is consumed mainly within the state itself as the consumers of the state prefer mustard oil to other edible oils. Major producing districts are West Champaran, Samastipur, Begusarai, Muzaffarpur, Khagaria, and Rohtas. These six districts together shared an area of 45 and 46 per cent during the years 2004-05 and 2005-06 respectively. Jute & mesta are the only fibre crops grown in the state, and the state’s position in area and production in the country is a distant second only after West Bengal.\n\nSugarcane\n\nAmong other commercial crops, sugarcane is important in the state. The state’s share in the country’s production is 4 to 4.5 percent and ranks 10th among the sugarcane-producing states. Sugarcane production and the sugar industry hold great potential in Bihar. In the case of sugarcane, production as well as productivity both increased between the period 2000-01 and 2006-07. In the year 2000-01, its production in Bihar was 3987.6 thousand tonnes and productivity was 42,648 kg/ha, while in case of all India, the same was 295,956.2 thousand tonnes and 68,577 kg/ha. However, in the year 2006-07, in Bihar, production increased to 4249.0 thousand tonnes and productivity increased to 41,252 kg/ha. While in case of India, production and productivity increased to 283,404 thousand tonnes and 64,615 kg/ha respectively. Area under sugarcane cultivation has also increased considerably in the State. (Annexure VI)\n\nThe Sugar Industry\n\nThe sugar industry is the largest agro-based industry in Bihar. It generates considerable employment in the farm sector directly as well as through ancillary industries and related activities. According to the estimate of 2006-07, the area under sugarcane cultivation is 117.2 thousand hectares, production accounts for 5338.8 thousand tonnes and productivity is 45,552 kg/ha against the national average of 70,469 kg/ha. Bihar has the lowest sugar recovery rate in the country at 9% against the national average of 10.36%.\n\nHorticulture\n\nNational Achievements in Agriculture\n\nThe country recorded an impressive achievement in agriculture after the Green Revolution in the late sixties, which enabled the country to overcome widespread hunger and starvation, achieve self-sufficiency in food, reduce poverty, and transform millions of families. This happened despite the fact that India is home to 16.8 percent of the global human population with 4.2 percent water and 2.3 percent of global land. Most important changes now being noticed in agriculture at the national level are diversification, modernization, market orientation, and commercialization, involving the introduction of new crops and varieties, increased share of horticulture in cropping patterns, diversion in processing, and export-oriented production. Growing importance of horticultural produce could be attributed to increasing demand due to the growth of a health-conscious population and enhanced income. Thus, the task before the state of Bihar is to harness the opportunity by converting weakness into strength, which will need a paradigm shift in thoughts and approaches from traditional systems to knowledge-based and technology-driven systems with efficiency as a central point, involving farmers in planning and execution.\n\nAgro-Climatic Diversity\n\nThe agro-climatic diversity in the State with its high rainfall distributed over a five-month monsoon and a reasonably long and moderate winter allows for a variety of horticultural crops to be grown. The agro-climatic conditions are eminently suitable for a whole range of vegetables; a variety of roots and tuber crops; perennial fruit crops like mango, litchi, guava, and limes; annual fruit crops like banana, pineapple, and papaya; and spices like ginger, turmeric, and chilly. Of late, floriculture is also showing excellent prospects. The state thus has possibilities for growing a diversified basket of vegetables, fruits, spices, tubers, flowers, and medicinal and aromatic plants.\n\nFruits\n\nMajor Fruits\n\nMajor fruits grown in the state are Mango, Litchi, Guava, Pineapple, Citrus, Banana, Papaya, and Ber. Mango is grown all over the state; main growing areas are Muzaffarpur, Vaishali, Bhagalpur, Darbhanga, Madhubani, Sitamarhi, Patna, and West Champaran. Litchi is mainly grown in Muzaffarpur, Vaishali, Sitamarhi, East and West Champaran, and Darbhanga of North Bihar region. Pineapple is grown in the northeastern part of the state, particularly in Kishanganj, Purnea, Araria, Katihar, and Saharsa districts. (Annexure VII & VIII)\n\nVegetables\n\nVegetable Production\n\nBihar ranks 3rd in vegetable production in the country and produces a variety of traditional and non-traditional vegetables. Climatic and soil conditions of the state are congenial for the production of different types of vegetables. However, it lacks the basic infrastructure for storage, packaging, transportation, organized marketing systems, and post-harvest handling facilities. Seed is the most important input that influences the output of vegetable crops. Vegetable production programs could be strengthened only if its seed production program is improved. Thus, the seed production program should be strengthened\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
