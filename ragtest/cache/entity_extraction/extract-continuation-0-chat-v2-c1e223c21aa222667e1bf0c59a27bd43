Plough down approach together with economical “No-till” methods should be tested for feasibility.\n(viii) Soil Health Cards should be distributed to each farmer involving village panchayats. Bi-annual soil testing should be made compulsory for village-level documentation at a subsidized rate through soil testing laboratories.\n(ix) A functional interactive website making total information available about the buyer meeting the producer cluster should be done for developing confidence for adding value to the market chain.\n(x) Private entrepreneurs can be invited to set up factories for manufacturing inputs for organic agriculture [biofertilizers, biopesticides, mechanized compost machines, etc.] processing of organic produce [post-harvest], etc.\nStrategy for Horticulture\nAn analysis of horticulture production in Bihar reveals that potential for significant increase in the horticulture production requires investments in all spheres—from institutional to crop management practices. Some strategic measures that can be implemented for the growth of the horticulture sector in Bihar include:\n(i) Establishing Horticultural Clusters and Dedicated Horticultural Zones.\n(ii) Promoting High-Value Crops and Diversification of Horticultural Production.\n(iii) Enhancing Research, Development, and Extension Services for Horticulture.\n(iv) Developing Infrastructure for Post-Harvest Management and Processing.\n(v) Strengthening Marketing Channels and Value Chains for Horticultural Products.\n\nDevelopment of Small Ruminants\nBreeding\n(i) Breeding of sheep and goats should aim at increasing body weight, reproductive efficiency, and viability, besides improvement in milk yield in goats.\n(ii) Germ plasm stations, either for AI or for distribution of maize, should be set up for each indigenous as well as exotic breed, more in line with bovine semen and bull stations.\n(iii) The emphasis in small ruminants should be to improve nutrition, breeding, and health cover.\n(iv) Financial support for the production of nucleus flock for each breed.\nAnimal Nutrition\n(i) Production of densified feed blocks for transporting crop residues from surplus to deficit areas and setting up fodder banks.\n(ii) Use of bypass protein supplements as top feed for growing, lactating, and pregnant animals.\n(iii) Development of biotechnology techniques which can develop recombinant microbes to digest straws, neutralize lignin and its byproducts, and release carbohydrates through a solid-state fermentation process.\n(iv) Strict quality assurance in feed requires: (a) Labeling. (b) System of Certification on the quality of Animal Feed. (c) Need to set up at least five laboratories in different regions with modern facilities. (d) Strengthening of existing testing laboratories.\n(v) Feed supplementation with mineral mixtures: (a) Region-wise mapping should be done for mineral status, and area-specific mineral mixtures need to be formulated. (b) Use of mineral mixtures needs to be popularized through extension activities. (c) Establishment of a mineral mixture plant for drought-prone/fodder deficit areas.\n(vi) Total mixed ration and balancing: (a) Farmers need to be advised to balance the ration of their animals with locally available feed resources. (b) ICAR institutions, KVKs, SAUs, NDDB offices could be used for training field resource persons and implementing the ration balancing program.\n(vii) Fodder Seed Production: (a) At least 10% of the total area under fodder production should be earmarked for the production of improved fodder seeds. (b) Large-scale fodder seed production needs to be assigned to dairy cooperatives, NGOs, and private agencies through contract farming.\n(viii) An integrated approach for pasture and fodder development in watershed areas is absolutely essential.\nAnimal Health\n(i) Disease reporting, monitoring, and surveillance systems should be strengthened. Infectious and contagious disease reporting should be closely monitored by state animal husbandry departments, dairy and poultry industries, cooperative NGOs, etc.\n(ii) Biological production units with marketing networks should be encouraged for the production and supply of diagnostic kits.\n(iii) Manpower – a separate cadre of specialists with appropriate qualifications is required to handle the animal health of the State.\n(iv) Infectious disease prevention and control programs need to be developed and further strengthened.\nPoultry Production\n(i) Creation of a network of diagnostic laboratories exclusively for poultry diseases and a prompt disease reporting system.\n(ii) Compulsory feed testing through designated laboratories for all commercial feed manufacturers.\n(iii) Facilitation of easy finance and easy insurance through NABARD.\n(iv) Regulation of contract farming with a legal framework.\n(v) Enforcing strict bio-security in poultry farms.\n(vi) Program on other avian species like quails, guinea fowls, and turkeys shall be strengthened to improve per capita availability of egg and meat in the State. The focus shall be to replace the local stock with improved egg and meat type breeds and exploring the possibility of introducing emu keeping in view environmental implications.\nBackyard Poultry Farming\n(i) The focus should be on providing genetic stock and technologies sustainable to rural poultry production.\n(ii) Supply of chicks of a desired breed. The low input technology birds should be kept in the State Government Poultry Farms to propagate and multiply. Availability and distribution of these chicks through a supply network should be established.\n(iii) Prevention from infectious diseases – Vaccination or treatment arranged for killer diseases or other diseases causing loss in production and body weight gain need to be addressed.\n(iv) Adequate shelter - The low-cost shelter with easily available material in a local area of production needs to be addressed.\nTraining and Human Resource Development\n(i) Although the State of Bihar has a college of Veterinary Science and Animal Husbandry, it is suffering from resource\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SOIL HEALTH CARDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A program involving village panchayats to distribute Soil Health Cards to farmers for bi-annual soil testing at a subsidized rate through soil testing laboratories)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HORTICULTURAL CLUSTERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Strategic measure for the growth of the horticulture sector in Bihar, involving the establishment of dedicated zones for horticulture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>State in India where strategic measures are being implemented for the growth of the horticulture sector and development of small ruminants)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ICAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Indian Council of Agricultural Research, involved in advising farmers on balancing the ration of their animals with locally available feed resources)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KVKs<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Krishi Vigyan Kendras, involved in training field resource persons and implementing the ration balancing program)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAUs<|>ORGANIZATION<|>State Agricultural Universities, involved in training and implementing ration balancing programs for animal nutrition)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NDDB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>National Dairy Development Board, offices could be used for training field resource persons and implementing the ration balancing program)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NABARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, involved in facilitating easy finance and insurance for poultry production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STATE GOVERNMENT POULTRY FARMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Facilities under the State Government of Bihar for propagating and multiplying desired breed chicks for backyard poultry farming)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COLLEGE OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Educational institution in Bihar suffering from resource limitations)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOIL HEALTH CARDS<|>BIHAR<|>Soil Health Cards program is implemented in Bihar involving village panchayats<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HORTICULTURAL CLUSTERS<|>BIHAR<|>Horticultural Clusters and Dedicated Horticultural Zones are strategic measures for horticulture growth in Bihar<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ICAR<|>BIHAR<|>ICAR institutions in Bihar advise farmers on animal nutrition and feed balancing<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KVKs<|>BIHAR<|>Krishi Vigyan Kendras in Bihar are involved in training for ration balancing programs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAUs<|>BIHAR<|>State Agricultural Universities in Bihar participate in training and ration balancing programs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NDDB<|>BIHAR<|>NDDB offices in Bihar could be used for training in ration balancing programs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NABARD<|>POULTRY PRODUCTION<|>NABARD facilitates easy finance and insurance for poultry production<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STATE GOVERNMENT POULTRY FARMS<|>BACKYARD POULTRY FARMING<|>State Government Poultry Farms in Bihar propagate and multiply chicks for backyard poultry farming<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COLLEGE OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY<|>BIHAR<|>The College of Veterinary Science and Animal Husbandry is an educational institution in Bihar facing resource challenges<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
