Across different districts, Rohtas emerged at the top with almost twice the yield level (0.25 t/ha.). Other districts to show relatively high yield included:\nBhojpur (0.15 t/ha.)\nPatna (0.12 t/ha.) in the south-west plains\nKatihar (0.14 t/ha.) and Purnea (0.12 t/ha.) in the east plains\nIn Begusarai, the largest chilli-growing district, the yield was much less at 0.65 t/ha. only. Among the districts of the north-west plains, the non-traditional chilli-growing districts showed higher yield than those in traditional chilli-growing districts. For example, it was high at 0.95 t/ha. in the non-traditional chilli-growing district of Gopalganj but low at 0.56 t/ha. in the traditional chilli-growing district of Samastipur.\nIV.10.13 Trend Rates of Growth in Yield\nZonewise analysis of the trend rates of growth in the yield of chilli clearly demonstrated that only the north-west alluvial plains (1.47%) had an increasing trend in yield during 1977-91. All other agro-climatic zones showed a declining trend. The rate of decline was as high as (-)5.15% per annum in the case of the east alluvial plains and (-)2.45% in the south-west alluvial plains. In the plateau districts, it declined annually at (-)1.94%. Between the two sub-periods, it showed an increasing trend in the first sub-period at 2.90% in the north-west alluvial plains, 0.07% in the east alluvial plains, and 4.22% in the plateau districts. However, the trend reversed to a declining rate in the second sub-period in all these zones at (-)3.78%, (-)11.00%, and (-)14.82% respectively. The south-west alluvial plains showed a declining trend in both the sub-periods at (-)1.90% and (-)2.30% respectively.\nIV.10.14 District Level Analysis\nAcross different districts, while the rate of growth in the yield of chilli was negative in most cases, there were districts that showed a high rate of growth during 1977-91. Such districts included:\nEast Champaran (6.20%)\nGopalganj (5.71%)\nSaran (6.04%)\nSiwan (6.21%)\nVaishali (10.21%)\nWest Champaran (6.10%)\nKatihar (5.92%)\nPurnea (5.19%)\nSaharsa (4.63%)\n\nV.11 Analysis of Acceleration/Deceleration\ni) Acceleration/Deceleration in Growth Rate\nIV.11.6 At the State level, the increasing trend rate of growth showed deceleration (-0.08%) during 1977-91. Between the two tobacco-growing zones, while the increasing trend rate of growth in the north-west plains showed acceleration (1.56%), the declining trend rate of growth in the east plains showed deceleration (-0.27%). Analysis across different districts suggests that the increasing trend growth rate in Samastipur showed acceleration (0.59%), but the declining trend in Vaishali showed deceleration (-0.24%). Most of the districts in these zones showed deceleration in their increasing trend growth rates. Districts with a declining trend also showed deceleration in their declining growth rates, except for Saran, where it was found to accelerate (0.24%).\nii) Area under Tobacco\nIV.11.7 Area under tobacco showed upward movement from 1986-87 and continued rising up to 1992-93. In the preceding period (1971-86), it showed complete stagnation with area under tobacco hovering around 12-13 thousand ha. The trend rate of growth during 1971-93 was observed to be positive at 0.98% per annum. It speeded up to 1.37% in the second sub-period as against a declining trend at (-0.36%) per annum in the first sub-period. The trend growth rate in area was impressive for Bihar when compared with the declining trend at (-1.0%) at the all-India level, (-1.05%) in Andhra Pradesh, and (-1.38%) in Gujarat during 1983-93.\nRegional Pattern\nIV.11.8 Zones/districts with high production of tobacco also had high area under this crop. The north-west plains, with an overwhelming share in tobacco production, had the highest area under this crop, forming 92.78% of the State's total area under tobacco. Similar patterns were observed across different districts. Samastipur and Vaishali, showing maximum tobacco production, had overwhelming shares in tobacco area in the State—47.97% for Vaishali and 32.42% for Samastipur. Other districts with relatively high shares in tobacco area included:\nMuzaffarpur (8.38%)\nGopalganj (1.09%)\nSiwan in the north-west plains\nPurnea (4.51%)\nBegusarai (1.21%) in the east plains\nIV.11.9 Among the two traditional tobacco-growing zones, the trend rate of growth was positive at 2.42% in the north-west alluvial plains and negative at (-3.18%) in the east alluvial plains during 1977-91.
