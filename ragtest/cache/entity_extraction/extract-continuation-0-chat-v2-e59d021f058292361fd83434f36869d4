The surplus land declared by the Government was observed to be grossly understated. According to Bharati, while the surplus land declared by the Government was 158.9 thousand hectares, the estimated surplus land was around 731.0 thousand hectares. Thus, the gap between the estimated surplus land and declared surplus was almost 4.5 times. Against the estimated surplus land, only 21.67% was found to have been acquired, and 14.77% was distributed.\n\nIV. Fragmentation of Land - Need for Consolidation\nXII.8 Fragmented Land Holdings\nThe problem of fragmented land holding is no less in Bihar. According to field investigations conducted by AERC, Shantiniketan, the average number of fragments per holding varied between 17 and 20 plots in Bihar in 1980-81. Over these years, the fragmentation of holding might have further increased mostly as a result of subdivisions. Iyer makes a similar observation to convey that \"lack of consolidation in Bihar has resulted in extreme scattering of land holdings. Often a land holding of five acres may be scattered over 10-15 plots and could be spread in different parts of the village. This creates a problem of manageability, forcing them to lease out land on a sharecropping basis.\"\nXII.9 Adverse Impacts of Fragmented Holdings\nSuch large fragmented holdings create a number of other adverse impacts as well, especially on the diffusion of modern technology. It restricts the application of mechanical mode. The kind of irrigation technologies being propagated and widely used in Bihar were also not appropriate in such a situation because of their non-divisibility. This hinders accessibility to irrigation on such plots of land despite immense groundwater irrigation potential. It also limits the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. If the gains of modern technology are to be reaped optimally and taken to the doors of cultivators, the consolidation of fragmented holdings would have to be accorded due importance. Although the program of consolidation was taken up in a number of districts, mainly in the north-west and the east plains, the program seems to have fizzled out, more on account of lack of political will on the one hand and absence of missionary zeal on the part of civil servants on the other.\n\nV. Concealed Tenancy\nXII.10 Need for Tenancy Reforms\nGoing by the success of Operation Barga in West Bengal, which facilitated tenancy reforms with a package of on-farm development programs, tenancy reforms in Bihar become all the more imperative, more so in the context of skewed land distribution and absentee landlords. Although the Bihar Tenancy Act was meant to confer ownership rights to cultivators of land on lease, its implementation has been observed to be largely ineffective. While the Tenancy Act is applicable in theory, its application on the ground has been negligible. The practice of oral tenancy continues to be prevalent and is often found to be exploitative in nature. The tenants, being insecure, have little incentive to invest in land, leading to under-investment. Moreover, there is a lack of institutional credit support to such tenants due to the prevailing security norms and rigidities of the bankers. This puts such farmers outside the gamut of bank loan for acquisition of land-based farm assets.\nXII.11 Concealed Tenancy Estimates\nThe extent of concealed tenancy is still widely disputed. While Prasad (1993) estimates it to be around 35.0% of sharecropping, Iyer (1993) considers it to be around 25.0%. Even if we consider the conservative estimate, i.e., 25%, the extent of absentee cultivation could be put at 16.60 lakh hectares, which constitutes 15.0% of the total area under operational holding in the State.\n\nVI. Forms of Tenancy\nXII.12 Types of Tenancy Arrangements\nResearch indicates that nearly one-third of tenants are pure tenants, while two-thirds are owner-cum-tenants. The pure tenants are predominantly from the scheduled castes and OBCs, while owner-cum-tenants include a larger proportion of OBCs and upper castes. It is observed that leasing out land often tends to be caste-based and fragmented to circumvent tenancy laws. Sharecropping, with crop sharing arrangements, is the dominant form of tenancy (97%), while fixed produce arrangements are rare. Fixed cash systems are also found to be rare. Sharecropping arrangements have been found to be exploitative, with tenants receiving only about 15.0% of net returns after deducting various expenses compared to 35.0% of net returns for landowners.\n\nVII. Absentee Cultivation\nXII.13 Issues with Absentee Cultivation\nAbsentee cultivation, which includes sharecroppers who cultivate land on lease from landlords not residing in the village (either working in the tertiary/service sector or residing in other villages), is considered one of the worst forms of sharecropping. It discourages all types of entrepreneurial and innovative approaches to farming, as absentee landlords typically show indifference to farm investments and maintenance. The extent of absentee cultivation in Bihar is subject to debate. While Prasad estimates it at 35.0% of sharecropping, Iyer estimates it at 25.0%. Even with a conservative estimate of 25%, absentee cultivation amounts to 16.60 lakh hectares, which forms 15.0% of the total area under operational holdings in the State.\n\nConclusions\nXII.18 Broad Conclusions\ni) Number of operational holdings was fast increasing in the State, rendering the operational holdings of a large number of marginal farmers as non-viable.\nii) The area under operational holdings showed a declining trend largely because of declining net sown area on the one hand and increasing current fallow/barren land on the other.\niii) Across different districts\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GOVERNMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Entity responsible for declaring surplus land, which was observed to be grossly understated compared to estimates provided by Bharati)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BHARATI<|>PERSON<|>Individual who provided estimates on surplus land, highlighting a significant discrepancy in government figures)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AERC, SHANTINIKETAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Research center that conducted field investigations on land fragmentation in Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>State in India facing issues of land fragmentation, ineffective tenancy reforms, and absentee cultivation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IYER<|>PERSON<|>Researcher who made observations on the lack of land consolidation in Bihar and provided estimates on concealed tenancy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPERATION BARGA<|>EVENT<|>Tenancy reform initiative in West Bengal aimed at conferring ownership rights to cultivators)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRASAD<|>PERSON<|>Researcher who provided estimates on the extent of concealed tenancy and absentee cultivation in Bihar)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BHARATI<|>GOVERNMENT<|>Bharati provided critical estimates on surplus land, contrasting with government figures<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AERC, SHANTINIKETAN<|>BIHAR<|>Conducted field investigations on land fragmentation in Bihar<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IYER<|>BIHAR<|>Made observations on the lack of land consolidation and provided estimates on concealed tenancy in Bihar<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPERATION BARGA<|>BIHAR<|>Serves as a reference point for the need for tenancy reforms in Bihar<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRASAD<|>BIHAR<|>Provided estimates on concealed tenancy and absentee cultivation in Bihar<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
