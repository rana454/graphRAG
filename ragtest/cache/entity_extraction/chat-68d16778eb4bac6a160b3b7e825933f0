One-fourth of 75% recommended N (80 kg/ha) and 75% recommended P and K (40 kg/ha) were applied as basal. No herbicide was used before sowing. Half of the 75% recommended N was applied 45 days after sowing (DAS), and the rest was applied at 70 DAS. Herbicide 2,4-diethyl ester was applied two times, one after 30 DAS and another at 45 DAS. Sesbania was fully destroyed at 55 DAS. Water management was done in a conventional manner. It was found that productivity increase due to brown manuring was marginal (1.3%) which may not favor brown manuring over the conventional method of cultivation. However, when the benefit-cost ratio is considered, brown manuring was found to be much more effective over the conventional method in diminishing the cost of cultivation (B\nratio of 1.15 compared to 0.74 in conventional). The main reason for the diminished cost of cultivation was less due to reduced fuel requirement for main field preparation. Also, the labor requirement was less in brown manuring (152 nos.) compared to conventional (170 nos.) practice. Brown manuring has another advantage in regards to soil quality preservation and remediation. In conventional rice cultivation, puddling has to be done to break down soil aggregates, reduce macro-porosity, disperse the clay fraction, and form a dense zone of compaction (i.e., ‘plough pan’) at depth. In addition to facilitating transplanting, puddling serves several functions including weed control and reduction in deep percolation losses of water.\nPaddy cum Daincha has been demonstrated in an area of 25 ha in Bihar and 35 ha in Jharkhand. The Paddy cum Daincha seeder recorded an average yield of 4950 kg/ha, which was 13.0% higher compared to the local check (Jaya).\n\nWomen Empowerment\nThe contribution of women in Indian agriculture is well recognized, though benefit sharing is not uniform in most cases. Considering the needs of the household, farm women remain engaged in income-generating activities, sacrificing their leisure periods. The farm women, either individually or in groups, mobilize scanty resources for the economic betterment of their families. The KVKs of Bihar and Jharkhand have contributed towards the socio-economic empowerment of a large number of farm women. The major initiative has been providing adequate knowledge and skills in agriculture as well as post-harvest technology including value addition, backyard livestock rearing, poultry rearing, handicrafts making, mushroom cultivation, vermicompost production, etc. In addition, the KVKs have formed a significant number of self-help groups (SHGs) on various enterprises along with providing support to SHGs formed by other organizations. In the process, visible changes in the economic condition of the farm women have been observed.\n\nNatural Resource Management\nNatural Resource Management through in-situ moisture conservation, land shaping & RWH, green manuring, 5% model of irrigation, crop residue management, aerial vegetable cultivation, bunding of field, BBF, soil conservation, soil test-based nutrient application, micro-irrigation techniques, compost pits, construction/renovation of new water harvesting and recycling structures, farm ponds/check dams/tank roof water harvesting tanks have been carried out by the KVKs of Bihar and Jharkhand. Some salient achievements of NRM activities are mentioned hereunder:\nImproving the Resilience of Poor Farmers by Reclaiming Cultivable Wastelands at Nawada, Bihar: The cluster of villages Vidyasagar & Gadimajhila, Nawada, is predominantly inhabited by Rajvanshi and Ravidas communities. The undulated lands are located in the fringe areas of forests and not cultivated despite being fertile. These were completely unprotected from grazing animals, and rainwater harvesting and storage structures (ahars) could not convey water due to their higher elevation. The cultivable fallow was brought back into crop production by motivating the community to participate in reclaiming the lands by bunding and leveling. About 15 ha was planted with pigeon pea during kharif, leading to a harvest of 10,000 kg of pigeon pea worth Rs. 3,50,000/-. For the first time, the farmers of these villages could realize such a harvest, helping them appreciate the worth of their land.\nDe-silting of Irrigation Channels for Coping with Water: The time required for irrigating one ha was brought down to 4.8 hr from 8 hr. This resulted in bringing 4 ha additionally under paddy. This generated an additional 600 man-days of work. It also saved enough water to provide one supplementary irrigation of 5 cm over 15 ha. The additional 4 ha brought under paddy could yield about 10 t worth Rs. 1.0 lakh.\nWater Security by Renovation of Abandoned Open Wells: So far, 28 wells have been renovated in this cluster of villages. The villagers are very happy with this intervention as it has ensured drinking water availability even in the midst of summer. The drainage line has also been developed, leading to safe disposal of water, improving hygiene around the wells. Overall, the well renovation intervention has been very well accepted by the villagers.\nRenovation of Ahar: Around 100 ha area was brought back into cultivation.\nSand Bag Check Dam - A Story of Success Against Fitting Climatic Variability at Gumla: A low-cost temporary structure was made on a river of 50-meter length. A huge quantity of water was reserved for supplemental and drinking (animal) purposes. The water table has risen by 44%, followed by area expansion under off-season vegetable\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
