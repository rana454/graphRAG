It increased at a compound annual rate of growth of 2.74% in the north-west, 2.72% in the south-west, and 2.57% in the east plains. Expansion in HYV wheat area was uniform across districts in these zones, regardless of wheat production levels. For example, Katihar and Darbhanga, with relatively low wheat production, showed impressive expansion in HYV area at over 3.0% per annum. Similarly, districts like Bhojpur, Begusarai, and Gopalganj, with high wheat production, also showed impressive expansion in HYV area at over 3.05% per annum.\nX.6.5 Plateau Region Trends\nThe plateau region showed a contrasting picture with HYV area shrinking at (-)5.99% per annum during 1980-91. This decline was uniform across different districts in this zone, except Hazaribagh, which showed an increasing trend in HYV area at 1.05% per annum. The rate of decline in HYV area was as high as (-)21.50% per annum in Singhbhum and (-)16.52% in Dhanbad.\nX.7 Relationship of HYV Area with Irrigation and Fertilizer\nX.7.1 Irrigation\nBaker and Herdt observed inadequacy of irrigation and water control as major constraints in the wider diffusion of rice HYV seeds. Ramasamy noted irrigation as an important determinant of HYV adoption for rice in Tamil Nadu. Examining the influence of irrigation on the adoption of HYV seeds for paddy, maize, and wheat in Bihar using a double log regression equation on district-wise time series data, it was found that irrigation positively influences the adoption of HYV area in Bihar. The elasticity of HYV on irrigation at the State level was 1.51 for paddy, 0.75 for wheat, and 0.23 for maize.\nX.7.2 Regional Trends\nComparing the elasticity of irrigation on HYV area for paddy across different zones/districts with the trend rate of growth in HYV area and net and gross irrigated area, it is observed that zones/districts with higher net/gross irrigated areas had a higher trend rate of growth in HYV area and vice versa. For example, plateau districts showed a consistent decline in irrigation availability and a shrinkage in HYV area for wheat and paddy. In contrast, plain land districts showed increased irrigation availability and growth in HYV paddy and wheat area. The elasticity of irrigation on HYV coverage for paddy and maize was positive and significant in plateau districts as well, indicating that farmers chose to use available scarce irrigation resources for these crops.\nX.7.3 Maize Trends\nMaize presented a contrasting picture with its HYV area showing a declining trend even in zones/districts with increasing irrigation networks. Still, the elasticity of irrigation on HYV maize area was positive and significant in most districts, including those in the plateau zone. The sharp decline in maize HYV area across different zones/districts could be attributed to a general abandonment of maize cultivation. The positive elasticity of irrigation suggests that irrigation was used for maize cultivation primarily under HYV seeds.\nX.7.4 Fertilizer\nFertilizer is essential for farmers to benefit from modern varieties of seeds, as modern varieties exhibit higher nutrient efficiency than traditional ones. In Bihar, there was a notable increase in fertilizer consumption, particularly after the mid-eighties. Analyzing the impact of HYVs on fertilizer consumption using time series data on fertilizer consumption and HYV area for paddy, wheat, and maize, and applying a double log regression equation, it was observed that with an increase in HYV area, fertilizer consumption also increased. The elasticity at the State level was 4.49. Across different zones/districts, plain alluvial land showed uniformly positive elasticities, while plateau districts exhibited negative elasticity, except for Hazaribagh. This suggests that districts with a sharp decline in irrigation also showed a decline in fertilizer consumption, particularly in the plateau zone where HYVs are not drought-resistant.\n\nConclusions\nX.19 Broad Conclusions on HYV Seed Area Trends in Bihar\ni) Coverage of HYV Area: Coverage of HYV area has been increasing for major crops such as paddy, wheat, and maize in the State. The pace of increase in HYV coverage was relatively more significant for paddy. Compared to agriculturally developed states, the coverage of HYV in Bihar was relatively low. For instance, it was much less for paddy at 33.86% in Bihar, compared to 94.17% in Punjab and 87.04% in Uttar Pradesh.\nii) Physical Area Trends: While maize HYV showed a declining trend in terms of physical area, paddy and wheat HYVs demonstrated an increasing trend.\niii) Regional Trends: Across different agro-climatic zones, the coverage of HYV showed an increasing trend in plain land zones. However, the plateau zone experienced a shrinkage in HYV coverage for all three major crops: paddy, wheat, and maize.\niv) Regional Specificity: Expansion in HYV area for paddy and wheat was region-specific to districts with high production of these crops.\nv) Maize HYV Expansion: Despite a general declining trend in maize HYV area, districts such as Begusar\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
