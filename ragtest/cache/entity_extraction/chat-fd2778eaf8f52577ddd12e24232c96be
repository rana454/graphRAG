In other agro-climatic zones, jute cultivation was virtually absent. Of the total jute production in the state, 98.83% was produced in the east plains alone. Among the districts of the east plains, Purnea, Saharsa, and Katihar had shares of 57.59%, 21.31%, and 19.87% respectively. Production of jute increased annually at 2.15% in this zone during 1977-91. Among the major jute-growing districts of the zone, it grew in the range of 2.89% to 2.02%. Bhagalpur and Begusarai, on the other hand, showed a declining trend at (-)4.53% and (-)4.86% respectively. Jute production increased impressively among the districts of this zone, except Purnea, during the second sub-period. While Begusarai and Bhagalpur picked up in jute production during this period with trend growth rates of 16.80% and 3.53% respectively, it showed a declining trend in Purnea at (-)5.98% as compared to the increasing trend of 3.70% in the first sub-period. Saharsa and Katihar maintained steady trends in growth rates at 4.47% and 1.10% respectively during the second sub-period.\nIV.8.4 Instability in Jute Production\nThe growth in jute production in Bihar was not stable, with a coefficient of variation in its growth during 1977-91 as high as 30.03%. Similar instability was observed in the east plains, with a coefficient of variation in the growth of jute production at 30.46%. Across major jute-growing districts, the coefficient of variation in the growth of jute production was also high, reaching 43.05% in Saharsa.\nIV.8.5 Analysis of Acceleration/Deceleration\nThere was deceleration in the increasing trend rate of growth of jute production at (-)0.73% for the state. Similar patterns were observed in the increasing trend growth rates of the east and north-west plains, with rates of deceleration at (-)4.20% and (-)0.15% respectively. Across major jute districts, the growth rate in production accelerated only in Bhagalpur (0.49%), West Champaran (1.57%), and Madhubani (2.36%). In all other districts, there was deceleration in the increasing trend growth rates.\nIV.8.6 Area Under Jute\nArea under jute in Bihar has remained almost stagnant during 1971-93. It was 141.80 thousand ha. in 1970-71, which increased marginally to 144.70 thousand ha. in 1992-93, recording around 2.0% expansion in 23 years. The minimum area cultivated under jute was 99.30 thousand ha. in 1975-76, and the maximum was 212.90 thousand ha. in 1985-86, with an index number touching 150 points. Year-to-year fluctuation in area, however, was not wide over these years. The trend rate of growth in jute area for 1971-93 was 0.52% per annum. Analyzing the trend growth rate separately for two sub-periods, it was observed to be increasing at 1.32% per annum in the first sub-period but declining at (-)0.32% per annum in the second sub-period.\nIV.8.7 Comparison with West Bengal\nCompared to jute area in West Bengal, it was much less in Bihar. For example, while in West Bengal jute was cultivated in 522.30 thousand ha., it was only 142.03 thousand ha. in Bihar in 1990-93. Area expansion under jute during 1983-93 was insignificant in both states, at a rate of 0.08% in West Bengal and 0.25% in Bihar.\nIV.8.8 Regional Pattern of Area Expansion\nArea expansion was not impressive in the major jute-growing zone of the east plains, growing annually at 0.79% during 1977-91. Across different districts, it was found to be declining in Begusarai and Bhagalpur at (-)4.35% and (-)8.92% respectively. Districts of Katihar, Purnea, and Saharsa, on the other hand, showed increasing trend rates of growth, although at varying levels. The rate of increase was low in Katihar and Purnea at 0.23% and 0.66% respectively. Saharsa showed a relatively more impressive increase at 2.08% per annum. The declining trend intensified in the second sub-period at (-)11.20% in Begusarai. In Purnea, it reversed from an increasing trend of 3.90% in the first sub-period to a declining trend of (-)0.86% in the second sub-period. Bhagalpur, however, showed an increasing trend in both sub-periods. Saharsa maintained a steady trend at 2.21% even in the second sub-period. In the case of Katihar, the rate of increase in jute area slackened from 3.70% in the first sub-period to 1.29% in the second sub-period.\nIV.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
