This method was adopted because we are interested in the elasticity of the explanatory variables. Accordingly, we first ran an ordinary least square model to analyze the determinants of agricultural growth in Bihar and then performed a unit root test on the residuals of the model to examine if it was stationary. The null hypothesis in the Engle-Granger procedure is no co-integration, and the alternative is co-integration.\n3. Agriculture in Bihar\n3.1 Geography, Demography, and Structural Composition\nBihar is a land-locked state situated in the eastern part of India, bordered by West Bengal to the east, Uttar Pradesh to the west, Nepal to the north, and Jharkhand to the south. The state covers a total geographical area of 9.4 million hectares and is divided into three agro-climatic zones: northwest alluvial, northeast alluvial, and south Bihar alluvial plains.\nAs of 2016, Bihar's population was approximately 115.2 million, accounting for about 8.8 percent of India’s population. It is the third most populous state, following Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra. The state has a very high population density of 1,218 people per square kilometer, compared to the national average of 396 people per square kilometer, which increases pressure on land and exacerbates rural poverty. Approximately 88.5 percent of the population lives in rural areas, compared to the national average of 68.8 percent, making Bihar largely a rural economy. Like the rest of the country, Bihar has undergone a structural shift from agriculture towards industry and services. The agricultural sector’s share in the total Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) has declined from 32.8 percent in the Triennium Ending (TE) 2003-04 to 22.0 percent in TE 2013-14, with a corresponding increase in the share of industry and services. Despite this decline in share, around 74 percent of the workforce relies on the agricultural sector for their livelihood, compared to the national average of 55 percent (Census 2011). Further, around 72 percent of the total agricultural workforce consists of agricultural laborers, while only 28 percent are cultivators (Census 2011), compared to the national average of 55 percent and 45 percent, respectively. The rural population in Bihar is not completely dependent on agriculture but also earns a part of their income as wage laborers, migrant laborers, and small entrepreneurs. The composition of agricultural income in the state is such that 48.2 percent is contributed by cultivation, 37.2 percent by wages, 7.8 percent by farming of animals, and 6.7 percent by farm business (NSS 70th Round).\n3.2 Water Resources and Climatic Risk\nBihar is divided into three agro-climatic zones: northwest alluvial, northeast alluvial, and south Bihar alluvial plains. The soil in the northwest region is mainly loam and sandy loam; the northeast region has loam and clay loam; and the south zone has sandy loam, loam, clay, and clay loam (Department of Agriculture, Bihar).\nThe state lies in the tropical and sub-tropical region, with an average rainfall of around 1,028 mm during the monsoon season. Approximately 85 percent of the total rainfall (normal 1,198 mm) in the state is received between June and September. However, there is wide variation in rainfall across agro-climatic zones; for example, the northwest zone receives a mean rainfall of 1,234.7 mm, the northeast zone 1,382.2 mm, and the south zone 1,102.1 mm.\nBihar's topography is described as a fertile alluvial plain lying wholly in the Gangetic Valley. The state is richly endowed with water resources, both ground and surface water. Besides rainfall, rivers that flow within the state are an important source of water. The main defining feature of the state is that the River Ganges flows through it and divides it broadly into water-abundant North and South Bihar. North Bihar benefits from the Himalayan Rivers, while South Bihar has rivers originating from central India. Most of the rivers in North Bihar, such as the Saryu (Ghaghra), Gandak, Burhi Gandak, Bagmati, Kamla-Balan, Koshi, and Mahananda (Adhwara group of rivers), are of Himalayan origin and have a considerable portion of their catchment in the glacial regions of Nepal and Tibet. They are positioned to receive copious amounts of rainfall during the monsoons. The southern part of Bihar, on the other hand, is drained by rivers that are largely rain-fed, having their origin either in the Vindhyachal Hills or in the hills of Chhotanagpur and Rajmahal. These rivers are either dry or have scanty discharge in non-monsoon months. Karmanasa, Sone, Punpun, Kiul, Badua, and Chandan are important rivers in this region.\nBihar's vast water resources also make it India’s most flood-prone state (Water Resource Department, Bihar). North Bihar, where around 76 percent of the population resides, is subject to recurring floods. The rivers of North Bihar, with 65 percent of their large catchment areas in the Himalayas in Nepal/Tibet, cause floods in around 74 percent of its geographical area. These rivers carry large amounts of water and a very high sediment load, which is deposited in the plains of\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
