For centrally sponsored schemes:\n   * ₹36,400 Lakh will be implemented, with the Central share being ₹21,840 Lakh and the State share being ₹14,560 Lakh.\n\n\n\n1.9 Climate Resilient Agriculture (CRA) Program\nBackground:\n* Extreme climatic conditions (floods, droughts, rainfall & temperature) that can lead to reduction in yields and shifts in cropping patterns.\n* Marginal holder farmers, constituting more than 91% of Bihar's population, face significant challenges.\n* Climate change affects agriculture and food production, increasing the frequency of extreme weather events and indirectly affecting crop growth and distribution.\n* Managing adverse effects of climate change is crucial for farmer livelihoods and food security.\nPartners:\n* Borlaug Institute for South Asia (BISA), Pusa\n* Bihar Agricultural University (BAU), Sabour\n* Dr Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University (RPCAU), Pusa\n* ICAR-Research Complex for Eastern Region (ICAR-RCER), Patna\nTechnical Support:\n* International Rice Research Institute (IRRI)\n* International Potato Center (CIP)\n* International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT)\nIntervention:\n* Laser land leveling\n* Climate-resilient varieties\n* Direct seeded rice\n* Zero tillage\n* Raised bed planting\n* Crop diversification\n* Precision input management\n* Intercropping\n* Community irrigation\n* Potato-based farming system\n* Crop residue management\n* Carbon credit\n* Solar harvesting\n* Millets in the food system\n* Empowering rural women\nKey Outputs\n1. Compendium of Climate Resilient Agriculture (CRA) Practices:\n   * Based on intensive knowledge, a compendium of fully validated CRA practices portfolio for the relevant agro-climatic zones.\n2. Zero Tillage (ZT) Systems:\n   * ZT systems help in advancing the planting dates of wheat by at least 7-10 days, saving land preparation time. It has been found that ZT rice followed by ZT wheat provides better net returns to small and marginal farmers.\n3. Farm Household Typologies:\n   * Farm household typologies will be developed for targeting CRA technologies, improving productivity by 35% and income by 50%, despite climate-related risks.\n4. Climate Resilient Germplasm:\n   * Climate-resilient germplasm of crops will be identified and made available to farmers.\n5. Capacity Building:\n   * Capacity building of 1,000 young researchers & extension agents, 1,900 service providers, and 750,000 farmers, enhancing understanding of climatic risks and adaptation strategies for large-scale adoption of CRA practices.\n6. Scalable Business Model:\n   * A scalable business model will be developed to scale up CRA practices involving farmers through a public-private engagement model.\n7. Efficiency Improvements:\n   * Water, nutrient, energy, labor, and time use-efficient CRA practices with 35% higher yields, improved soil health, and reduced environmental footprint by 25%.\n8. Carbon-Friendly Intensification:\n   * Achieving carbon-friendly intensification and systems resilience: ZT plays a significant role in minimizing emissions of GHGs.\n9. Farm Machinery:\n   * Introduction of several new technologies in farm machinery such as Laser Land Leveler, Tractor Mounted Sprayer, Zero Tillage Machine, Raised Bed Planter, and Happy Seeder.\n\n\n\nKey Outcomes\n1. Development of CRA Practices Portfolio:\n   * Development of CRA practices portfolio with economically compatible technologies for large-scale use under diverse climatic conditions.\n2. Empowering Smallholder Farmers:\n   * Empowering smallholder farmers to combat climate change.\n3. Development of Linkages:\n   * Development of linkages with FPOs, private companies, and e-market/digital market.\n4. Economic Upliftment:\n   * Economic upliftment of farmers in Bihar State.\n5. Job & Enterprises:\n   * 3,800 jobs, 380 SHGs, and 38 FPOs will be created in five years.\n6. Budget:\n   * ₹52,606 Lakh.\n\n\n\nHorticulture Sector Overview\n* Importance:\n   * Food, livelihood, nutritional security, employment generation, and health care are crucial to human and socio-economic development. The horticulture sector, including fruits, vegetables, tuber crops, floriculture, mushrooms, beekeeping, spices, plantation crops, and aromatic & medicinal plants, is considered a sunrise sector due to its universal appeal, higher biomass production per unit area, and scope for employment generation and value addition.\n* Current State:\n   * Horticulture has become a sustainable and viable option for small and marginal farms and a better commercial venture for entrepreneurs. Despite suitable agro-climatic conditions in Bihar, production constraints, lack of technology advancement, and marketing issues act as impediments.\n* Impact of Previous Krishi Road Maps:\n   * The State Government has promoted various technologies and management practices through multiple schemes to increase quality production and productivity. The impact of the Krishi Road Maps is evident in the following:\nCrop\n\tProduction (Lakh MT)\n\tProductivity (Q/ha)\n\tIncrement in Production (%)\n\tIncrement in Productivity (%)\n\tFruits\n\t32.28\n\t112.90\n\t45.36\n\t136.90\n\tVegetables\n\t101.03\n\t159.40\n\t169.25\n\t194.60\n\t* \nSchemes Implemented:\n   * The Directorate of Horticulture, Department of Agriculture, Government of Bihar, is implementing various centrally and state-sponsored schemes such as Mission on Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), Chief Minister Horticulture Mission, Pradhan Mantri Kr\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>STATE PLAN<|>EVENT<|>Implementation of ₹145,059 Lakh under the State Plan for various projects)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTRALLY SPONSORED SCHEMES<|>EVENT<|>Implementation of ₹36,400 Lakh with Central and State shares for sponsored schemes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIMATE RESILIENT AGRICULTURE PROGRAM<|>EVENT<|>A program aimed at addressing the impacts of climate change on agriculture through various interventions and partnerships)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BORLAUG INSTITUTE FOR SOUTH ASIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An institute partnering in the Climate Resilient Agriculture Program, located in Pusa)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A university in Sabour partnering in the Climate Resilient Agriculture Program)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DR RAJENDRA PRASAD CENTRAL AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A university in Pusa partnering in the Climate Resilient Agriculture Program)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ICAR-RESEARCH COMPLEX FOR EASTERN REGION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An organization in Patna providing technical support for the Climate Resilient Agriculture Program)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERNATIONAL RICE RESEARCH INSTITUTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An institute providing technical support for the Climate Resilient Agriculture Program)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERNATIONAL POTATO CENTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An organization providing technical support for the Climate Resilient Agriculture Program)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERNATIONAL CROPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR THE SEMI-ARID TROPICS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An institute providing technical support for the Climate Resilient Agriculture Program)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>State in India where the Climate Resilient Agriculture Program is being implemented)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLIMATE RESILIENT AGRICULTURE PROGRAM<|>BORLAUG INSTITUTE FOR SOUTH ASIA<|>The Borlaug Institute for South Asia is a partner in the Climate Resilient Agriculture Program<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLIMATE RESILIENT AGRICULTURE PROGRAM<|>BIHAR AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY<|>Bihar Agricultural University is a partner in the Climate Resilient Agriculture Program<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLIMATE RESILIENT AGRICULTURE PROGRAM<|>DR RAJENDRA PRASAD CENTRAL AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY<|>Dr Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University is a partner in the Climate Resilient Agriculture Program<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLIMATE RESILIENT AGRICULTURE PROGRAM<|>ICAR-RESEARCH COMPLEX FOR EASTERN REGION<|>ICAR-Research Complex for Eastern Region provides technical support for the Climate Resilient Agriculture Program<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLIMATE RESILIENT AGRICULTURE PROGRAM<|>INTERNATIONAL RICE RESEARCH INSTITUTE<|>International Rice Research Institute provides technical support for the Climate Resilient Agriculture Program<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLIMATE RESILIENT AGRICULTURE PROGRAM<|>INTERNATIONAL POTATO CENTER<|>International Potato Center provides technical support for the Climate Resilient Agriculture Program<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLIMATE RESILIENT AGRICULTURE PROGRAM<|>INTERNATIONAL CROPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR THE SEMI-ARID TROPICS<|>International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics provides technical support for the Climate Resilient Agriculture Program<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
