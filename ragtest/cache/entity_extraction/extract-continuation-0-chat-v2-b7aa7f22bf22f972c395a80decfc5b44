Office Attendant: 80\nThe amount to be spent in one year on already approved 305 posts is ₹1,72,81,226.00. For 348 posts, ₹1,98,09,514.00 will be spent on the salary item. Additional expenditure incurred in one year after acceptance of additional 43 posts is as follows:\nAmount: ₹2,52,88,288.00\nYear-wise Details:\n* 2023-24\n* 2024-25\n* 2025-26\n* 2026-27\n* 2027-28\nThe total amount to be spent in the financial year 2023-24 to 2027-28 is ₹15,43,88,000.00. This amount will be spent from the non-plan item; hence, it has not been calculated under the ongoing scheme component.\n\n\n\nFunding Sources and Allocation\n1. Under the State Plan and Sat Nischay-2\n   * The total amount will be spent from the state fund.\n2. Under the Centrally Sponsored Watershed Development Component - Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana 2.0\n   * The percentage of central share and state share is 60:40. Under this scheme, the amount will be spent by combining the central share item and proportionate state share to be made available by the Government of India.\nExpected Results from Need-Based Planning\nKeeping in view the overall approach of agriculture sector development, need-based planning will be implemented in the identified watershed area of South Bihar and outside the watershed. The following results can be expected:\n1. Increase in Agricultural Land and Green Area:\n   * There will be an increase in agricultural land and green area.\n2. Improvement in Underground Water Level and Soil Moisture:\n   * Along with an increase in underground water level and soil moisture, erosion of fertile soil will be prevented as much as possible.\n3. Development of Irrigation Facilities:\n   * As a result of the development of irrigation facilities due to maximum conservation of rainwater, there will be an increase in crop production, horticulture development, and fisheries. This will also improve the economic condition of the villagers and provide self-employment to the unemployed.\nAgricultural Mechanization Scheme\nBihar is predominantly an agrarian state. Most of the population in the state is directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture. The production and productivity of crops can be increased by adopting advanced agricultural machinery. Time, manpower, and money can also be saved by the use of agricultural machinery.\nImplementation of the Agricultural Mechanization Scheme\n* Subsidy on Agricultural Machines:\n   * The State Government is implementing the Agricultural Mechanization Scheme in all districts, providing subsidies on agricultural machines, including machines from tillage to harvesting and threshing.\n* Control of Crop Residue Burning:\n   * Subsidy is also given on equipment related to crop residue management.\n* Online Farm Mechanization Application Software (OFMAS):\n   * Developed in 2014-15 by the Department of Agriculture, this software allows farmers to apply online for subsidies on various agricultural machines. Permits are issued after application verification, enabling farmers to purchase machinery at subsidized rates from authorized dealers.\n* Quality Assurance:\n   * Only those agricultural machines tested and certified by designated institutions recognized by the Government of India are included in the subsidy scheme. Agricultural Mechanization Fairs are organized to showcase quality machinery at subsidized rates.\nAchievements of Previous Agricultural Road Maps\n* Increased Use of Machinery:\n   * Advanced agricultural machines are used for various agricultural activities. Approximately 80% or more of tillage, spraying, and threshing works are done through machines. Machine use in harvesting is about 35-40%, in sowing is 15-20%, and in weeding is about 10-15%.\n* Farm Power Availability:\n   * Farm power availability increased from 0.8 kW/Ha in 2008 to 3.21 kW/Ha in 2021-22.\n* Distribution of Agricultural Machines:\n   * A total of 27,77,925 agricultural machines were distributed among farmers at subsidized rates with a total subsidy amount of ₹1,846.43 crores.\n* Custom Hiring Centers:\n   * 660 custom hiring centers and 21 Special Custom Hiring Centers for crop residue management were established.\nPriorities Under the Fourth Agriculture Road Map\n1. Increase Farm Power Availability:\n   * To increase farm power availability to 4.50 kW/Ha by providing advanced agricultural machinery to farmers at subsidized rates.\n2. Establish New Custom Hiring Centers:\n   * To establish 5000 new custom hiring centers/farm machinery banks to facilitate access to advanced machinery for farmers with small holdings.\n3. Special Custom Hiring Centers:\n   * To establish 500 Special Custom Hiring Centers to control crop residue burning.\n4. Skilled Repairman Training:\n   * To provide a skilled repairman for every panchayat by imparting practical training for repairing agricultural machinery.\n5. Quality Testing Center:\n   * To establish a quality testing center to ensure the quality of equipment supplied to farmers.\nSummary of DPR 01 - Financial Assistance for Procurement of Agricultural Machinery\nObjectives:\n1. Increase Productivity and Production:\n   * Maximum use of machinery to increase productivity and production.\n2. Save Time, Money, and Labor:\n   * Save time, money, and labor through timely execution of agricultural operations.\n3. Promotion of Mechanization:\n   * Promotion of crop-based mechanization and machinery for line sowing, post-harvest, and horticulture.\nIntervention\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PRADHAN MANTRI KRISHI SINCHAI YOJANA 2.0<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A Centrally Sponsored Watershed Development Component aiming to improve agricultural productivity through better irrigation and water conservation techniques, with funding shared between the central and state governments in a 60:40 ratio\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>An agrarian state in India where agriculture is the primary occupation for the majority of its population.
