Crop Husbandry\nAgriculture is the mainstay of the stateâ€™s economy. Nearly 60% of the area under cultivation in Bihar is rainfed. A wide variety of crops, viz. cereals, oilseeds, pulses, fruits, and vegetables, are grown in Bihar. Principal crops in Bihar are:\nCereals: Rice, Wheat, Barley, Maize\nPulses: Gram, Lentil, Arhar, Khesari, Peas\nCommercial Crops: Sugarcane, Tobacco, Jute\nHorticultural Crops: Mango, Litchi, Banana, Makhana, Jackfruit, Guava, Water Chestnut, Potato, Betel leaves, Chilly\nThe major agricultural products of Bihar are cereals, pulses, oilseeds, and cash crops. However, cereals dominate the cropping pattern. The rice-wheat cropping system occupies more than 70% of the gross cropped area but productivity has remained low despite favorable soil, water, and climatic conditions. The yield per hectare of rice is around 1500 kg/ha against the national average of 2100 kg/ha. Rice and wheat are the staple food of the people of the state. Production of rice has decreased from 5442.6 thousand tonnes to 3775.4 thousand tonnes between the period 2000-01 and 2007-08. During the same period, productivity has also decreased from 1489 kg/ha to 1143 kg/ha. This decline in productivity is basically due to the replacement of upland rice by higher income-generating crops like pulses, oilseeds, and maize.\nSimilarly, in the case of wheat, production has declined from 4438 thousand tonnes to 3474 thousand tonnes between the period 2000-01 and 2006-07. Wheat production in the state is suffering from problems of delayed sowing, increased cost of production due to the rise in the cost of petroleum oil, lack of small-duration varieties which can be appropriately tailored into the rice-wheat system, and aberrations in weather conditions.\nThe yield per hectare of maize and pulses is, however, higher than the all-India average. Production of maize is also very good, and Bihar is one of the leading states in maize production. Maize has multiple uses, viz. baby corn, sweet corn, popcorn, and green corn. These different varieties are commercially very profitable. Maize is called the industrial crop of the 21st century due to its versatility in use as food, animal feed, and as raw material for ethanol, starch, and corn oil industries. As compared to the national average, production of maize is increasing in the state. As the data shows, the productivity of maize in Bihar (2541 kg/ha in 2006-07) is greater than that of All-India (1907 kg/ha). This crop is now replacing upland rice in the Kharif season and wheat in the Rabi season.\nAutumn maize has the largest share of area under the crop, being 42 to 43 percent of the total, followed by Rabi maize 31 to 32 percent and summer maize 25 to 26 percent. Though autumn maize has the largest share in area, it contributes only 30 to 31 percent of the total production, only marginally higher than that of summer maize, which has a share of 29 to 30 percent. Rabi maize has a better yield rate than that of autumn maize and thus produces nearly 40 to 41 percent of the crop in the state. The crop is now replacing upland rice in the Kharif season and wheat in the Rabi season in Bihar. Although maize is produced practically in all the districts of Bihar, major maize-producing districts are Begusarai (10.5%), Samastipur (7.6%), Bhagalpur (7.6%), Khagaria (7.4%), and Purnea (6.8%). With rich water resources and available irrigation in the winter and summer seasons, the irrigated area under maize increased and so did the yields. Both traditional and hybrid maize are grown in all three seasons. Percentage shares of area under hybrid maize in the total maize crop of autumn and summer seasons are 40 to 43 percent and 70 to 73 percent respectively, and the production of hybrid maize in these two seasons constitutes nearly 43 to 45 percent and 71 to 72 percent respectively. However, the break-up of area and production in respect of hybrid and traditional varieties for the Rabi season is not available.\nPulses Industry\n\nThere is a good scope for the pulses industry also. In case of pulses, productivity in the state is greater than All-India. In the year 2006-07, in Bihar it is 735 kg/ha while in India it is 616 kg/ha. Gram, Tur, and Lentil are the major pulses grown in the State.\n\nOilseeds\n\nOilseeds cover less than 2 per cent of the gross cropped area of the state. The stateâ€™s position in the country in area and production is insignificant being less than 1 per cent each. Rapeseed and mustard are the major oilseeds crops in the state followed by linseed which is generally used as the cooking medium. The crop is grown in all the 38 districts and the produce is consumed mainly within the state itself as the consumers of the state prefer mustard oil to other edible oils. Major producing districts are West Champaran, Samastipur, Begusarai,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
