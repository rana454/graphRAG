Such a shift in policy will both ensure a supply of diverse micronutrient-rich foods in the state and generate demand for the same. Increased demand can also stem from increases in the incomes of smallholder farmers as yields of rice and wheat are improved. Some strategies for this include strengthening the input supply chain and ensuring access to technologies and information by way of extension services. Well-functioning market arrangements, along with procurement policies, are also important for price realization. Women farmers cannot be excluded from such policy changes, and therefore, their access to productive inputs and control over income should be ensured. Behavior change campaigns should address stakeholders at all points of the food system:\nFarmers — about the importance of cultivating diversified crops for nutrition;\nWomen — about the importance of cultivating, purchasing, preparing, and distributing nutritious foods within the household;\nCommunities — about the importance of clean water and hygiene for eventual nutrient absorption.\nTargets\n2.1 | By 2030, end hunger and ensure access by all people, in particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations, including infants, to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food all year round.\n2.2 | By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women, and older persons.\n2.3 | By 2030, double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers, in particular women, indigenous peoples, family farmers, pastoralists, and fishers, including through secure and equal access to land, other productive resources and inputs, knowledge, financial services, markets, and opportunities for value addition and non-farm employment.\n2.4 | By 2030, ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and production, help maintain ecosystems, strengthen capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding, and other disasters, and progressively improve land and soil quality.\n2.5 | By 2020, maintain the genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants, and farmed and domesticated animals and their related wild species, including through soundly managed and diversified seed and plant banks at the national, regional, and international levels, and promote access to and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge, as internationally agreed.\n2A | Increase investment, including through enhanced international cooperation, in rural infrastructure, agricultural research and extension services, technology development, and plant and livestock gene banks in order to enhance agricultural productive capacity in developing countries, particularly least developed countries.\n2B | Correct and prevent trade restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets, including through the parallel elimination of all forms of agricultural export subsidies and all export measures with equivalent effect, in accordance with the mandate of the Doha Development Round.\n2C | Adopt measures to ensure the proper functioning of food commodity markets and their derivatives and facilitate timely access to market information, including on food reserves, in order to help limit extreme food price volatility.\nEnd hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture.\nBox 2.1 | DISTRIBUTION OF HOUSEHOLDS BY WEALTH INDEX IN BIHAR\nThe National Family Health Survey (NFHS) classifies households in every district into five distinct wealth quintiles: poorest, poorer, middle, richer, and richest. Such a classification of wealth categories allows us to view the distribution of wealth within each district and make comparisons within the state. NFHS uses two different indices. The first is an all-India wealth index based on average wealth levels across the entire country. The second is a state-specific wealth index. In Bihar’s case, it generates the quintiles based on the wealth distribution within the state. These two indices result in two very different pictures of poverty in Bihar.\nIf we consider the two lowest quintiles, then the share of households falling in the poorest and poorer quintiles can be used as a proxy for poverty estimates. If the national-level wealth index is used, then 48 percent of households fall into the poorest quintile in the state and an additional 23 percent into the poorer quintile. Together, this suggests that around 70 percent of households can be classified as poor in the state, compared to around 40 percent in the country overall, on average. On the other hand, if the state-specific rural wealth index for Bihar is used, then the proportions of poor households in Bihar and India are similar at about 40 percent. Not only does the overall prevalence of poverty differ based on the index used, but the indices also result in very different rankings of districts.\n\nRelationship Between Income and Nutritional Status\nThere is a clear relationship between income and nutritional status across districts of Bihar. Rates of child malnutrition, as reflected in stunting, wasting, and underweight, are significantly higher in the poorest wealth quintiles and decrease as household incomes increase (Figure 2.3). One of the factors that has been identified as an immediate cause of poor nutritional outcomes is the intake of a diet that lacks enough calories and\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India that is working towards meeting its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Vision report, with a focus on improving agricultural policies and nutritional outcomes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SDGS<|>EVENT<|>Sustainable Development Goals aimed at ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture by 2030)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL FAMILY HEALTH SURVEY (NFHS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An organization that classifies households in every district into wealth quintiles and provides data on poverty and nutritional status in Bihar)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>SDGS<|>Bihar's efforts in planning, budgeting, and implementing policies are aimed at achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly in agriculture and nutrition<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>NATIONAL FAMILY HEALTH SURVEY (NFHS)<|>The NFHS provides crucial data on the distribution of wealth and nutritional status in Bihar, which is essential for policy formulation and assessment<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
