The share of regional rural banks in total agricultural credit has fluctuated around 20 percent, although it registered a sharp fall in 2003-04 to 13 percent. Similarly, the share of cooperative banks in total agricultural credit is found to be about 12 percent, although it was suddenly high at 36 percent in 2003-04.\nThe agricultural credit need was estimated to be Rs. 11,341.22 crore for Bihar in 2006-07. An amount of Rs. 10,042 crore for crop loans, Rs. 78.22 crore for the Macromode/ISOPAM plan, Rs. 60 crore for micro-irrigation, Rs. 18.50 crore for agri-clinics, and Rs. 1,142 crore for horticulture mission etc. would be needed as a loan from the banking sector. However, the credit target for agriculture set by banks for 2006-07 was only Rs. 3,732 crore, which was much lower than the requirement. Kisan Credit Card (KCC) is an important medium for increasing agricultural credit. At present, there are 1.04 crore land holdings in the State, but till 2005-06, only 1,450,779 KCCs have been distributed against the target of 3,047,536. To meet the target of crop loans of Rs. 10,042 crore in 2006-07, KCCs have to play a very important role. Although total disbursement under KCC has increased almost 2.5 times, from Rs. 342 crore in 2002-03 to Rs. 815 crore in 2005-06 (Table 2.22), it still channels only a minuscule proportion of the total credit volume for crop loans. A target of 6 lakh more KCCs has been fixed by the banks for 2006-07. But even this target is grossly inadequate to measure up to the total credit demand in the current year. In the area of micro-finance, more than 17,000 Self-Help Groups had been financed by banks up to 2005 through their priority lending schemes in 38 districts. The target for 2006-07 is to raise the number to 24,000 SHGs and advance Rs. 48 crore through the scheme.\nInsurance\nAgricultural production in Bihar has shown great fluctuation over the years. On one hand, this fluctuation can be devastating for a small-margin farmer who operates on the limits of subsistence, and on the other hand, it is a disincentive for enterprising farmers who have the potential for investment. In this perspective, crops in the State are being insured since kharif 2000 to provide economic help to the insured farmers whose crops are damaged by natural disasters. Kharif crops such as paddy, maize, jute, and chillies, and among rabi crops, wheat, gram, arhar, masoor, maize, rapeseed and mustard, potato, sugarcane, and onion are covered under the National Agricultural Insurance Plan. While participation of indebted farmers is compulsory in the plan, that of non-indebted farmers is voluntary.\nUnder this plan, grants are given in the premium to be paid by the small and marginal farmers, with equal shares of State and Central government. The number of beneficiary farmers for 2004-05 was 411,532, with 293,442 in kharif and 118,090 in rabi season. There has been a drop in coverage of farmers under crop insurance in 2005-06 as compared to 2004-05. Crop insurance policy was taken by 409,946 farmers in 2005-06, out of which 221,985 took cover for the kharif season and 187,961 for the rabi season. Insurance coverage in Bihar is inadequate considering that there are around 10.4 million landholdings in the State, with nearly 93 percent being small and marginal holdings requiring protection through the insurance plan.\nExtension Services\nThe importance of agricultural research and extension to farmers cannot be overemphasized. In Bihar, there is a significant gap between the technology available in agricultural universities/institutions and that on the field. Public Sector Agricultural Research and Extension System in the State involves Rajendra Agricultural University for research and education, seven research centers/stations of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, and various State government departments for agricultural extension and regulatory services. However, the agricultural research and extension system has not been fully effective in developing and disseminating appropriate technologies. The national level spending on agricultural research stands at 0.4 percent of agricultural GDP, whereas Bihar's spending is only 0.2 percent of agricultural GDP. Of this, 95 percent is on salaries and only 5 percent for establishment expenses.\nAccording to NSSO 2003 figures, only 0.5 percent of farmers access information on modern technology from extension workers. Recent steps to address this situation include the universalization of Agricultural Technology Management Agencies (ATMAs) and Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) to cover all districts of the State. Additionally, 31 new soil-testing laboratories were sanctioned this financial year, adding to the existing 23. Furthermore, a mega-project of Rs. 309 crore has been sanctioned to establish soil testing laboratories in all 534 blocks over the next 4 years.\n\n 2.6 Seed Supply Management\nManagement of seed supply is an important component of any programme of agricultural development. In the current year, Bihar State Seed Corporation has been revived and production of seeds is being undertaken by it on 45 state-managed farms which remained inoperative for some years. More than 1100 agriculture graduates have been trained as agric\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India with significant agricultural activity, facing challenges in agricultural credit, insurance, and extension services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KISAN CREDIT CARD (KCC)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A medium for increasing agricultural credit in Bihar, with a significant number of land holdings but insufficient distribution of KCCs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL INSURANCE PLAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A plan that insures crops in Bihar against natural disasters, with compulsory participation for indebted farmers and voluntary for non-indebted)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAJENDRA AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An institution involved in agricultural research and education in Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDIAN COUNCIL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Operates seven research centers/stations in Bihar for agricultural research)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT AGENCIES (ATMAs)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Part of the effort to universalize access to modern agricultural technologies across all districts in Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KRISHI VIGYAN KENDRAS (KVKs)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Centers for agricultural science that aim to reduce the gap between technology available in institutions and that on the field in Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR STATE SEED CORPORATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Revived to manage seed supply and undertake production on state-managed farms in Bihar)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KISAN CREDIT CARD (KCC)<|>BIHAR<|>KCC is crucial for meeting the agricultural credit needs in Bihar<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL INSURANCE PLAN<|>BIHAR<|>Provides crop insurance to farmers in Bihar against natural disasters<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAJENDRA AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY<|>BIHAR<|>Contributes to agricultural research and education in Bihar<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INDIAN COUNCIL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH<|>BIHAR<|>Operates research centers/stations in Bihar for agricultural research<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT AGENCIES (ATMAs)<|>BIHAR<|>ATMAs aim to universalize access to modern agricultural technologies in Bihar<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KRISHI VIGYAN KENDRAS (KVKs)<|>BIHAR<|>KVKs aim to reduce the technology gap in the agricultural sector of Bihar<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR STATE SEED CORPORATION<|>BIHAR<|>Manages seed supply and production to support agricultural development in Bihar<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
