Shift in area was more prominent during the second sub-period with a trend rate of growth at 0.29% as against 0.15% in the first sub-period. Sunhemp showed a reversal in its relative share in the second sub-period with a declining rate of growth at (-2.68%), whereas during the first sub-period it showed an increasing rate of growth at 2.55% per annum. Mesta, only next to jute among the fibre crops, showed a declining trend rate of growth during both sub-periods, at (-1.34%) in the first sub-period and (-0.82%) in the second sub-period.\nV.18 Spices\nTurmeric and chillies were the two major spice crops cultivated in Bihar. The relative share of spice crops showed a declining trend during both sub-periods, implying a loss of their area to other crops. However, analysis of the relative share of chili and turmeric throws significant light:\nChili gained in area during the first sub-period with a trend growth rate increasing annually at 0.81%, but reversed to a declining trend in the second sub-period at (-1.96%) per annum.\nTurmeric showed a loss in area during the first sub-period at (-1.66%) per annum but reversed to an increasing trend at 4.19% per annum in the second sub-period.\nV.19 Sugarcane and Tobacco\nThe relative share of sugarcane and tobacco is analyzed in terms of their share in gross cropped area:\nSugarcane gained in its share impressively during the second sub-period at 2.85% as against a declining trend in the first sub-period at (-1.38%) per annum.\nTobacco showed gains in area during both sub-periods, with a relatively higher gain of 2.27% in the second sub-period compared to 0.82% in the first sub-period.\n\nCHAPTER V: ANALYSIS OF AREA SHIFTS ACROSS CROPS\nV.20 Conclusions\nThe following broad conclusions may thus be arrived at on the basis of the foregoing discussions with regard to the trend and pattern of area shifts across various crops and crop groups:\ni. Bihar agriculture continues to be dominant in foodgrains production with its area at 91.77% in 1990-93. Among the food crops, it was essentially cereals (80.50%) which was prominent, as pulses area covered 11.27% only. Paddy, wheat, and maize were the major cereal crops.\nii. Non-food crops constituted merely 8.23% of the gross cropped area in the state. Among the non-food crops, rapeseed/mustard, linseed, jute, mesta, potato, and sugarcane had a dominant share. Chilli, turmeric, coriander, and tobacco were also grown in the state, but in specific regions only.\niii. Over the years, there was a clear shift of area in favor of cereals, fruits and vegetables, and fibre crops. On the other hand, crop groups such as pulses, oilseeds, spices, and miscellaneous crops showed a loss of area.\niv. Among the cereals, while superior cereals gained in area, coarse cereals recorded a loss of area. In the case of pulses, while arhar and gram recorded a loss of area, other pulses showed gains in area.\nv. While oilseeds in general showed a loss of area, rapeseed/mustard recorded impressive gains in area. Linseed and nigerseed showed a loss of area.\nvi. Among the fibre crops, jute alone showed gains in area, whereas mesta and sunhemp recorded a loss of area. Turmeric and chillies, among the spices crops, also showed a significant loss of area. Sugarcane recorded impressive gains in area.\nCHAPTER VI: YIELD INCREASE - CROP-WISE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS\nThe question of which crop has gained in yield expansion over these years becomes important to understand the relative position of a crop vis-a-vis other crops in yield gains to facilitate policy decisions. The present chapter seeks to address this question at the State level. For this purpose, major crops alone were considered. The period under consideration is 1970-71 to 1992-93. For each of these years, yield per hectare is arrived at from the area and production data. For each of these crops, trend growth rates were worked out in their yield levels to reflect the rate of change as well as direction of change for the period during 1970-71 to 1992-93. Trend rates of growth in the yield of these crops were worked out separately for two sub-periods as well.\na) Cereal Crops\nVI.2 Across various cereal crops, the yield of maize was increasing annually at 3.49% per annum during 1971-93. Ragi and small millets followed with trend rates of growth at 2.67% per annum for both crops. Jowar and barley recorded growth in yield at 2.24% and 2.07% respectively. Wheat recorded a growth rate in its yield at 1.77%, which was much less than that of maize or for that matter even ragi and small millets. Rice and bajra showed the lowest rates of yield increase at 1.30% and 1.18% per annum\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JUTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A major fibre crop that saw an increase in its area share, particularly dominant in the fibre crop sector with a growth rate of 0.38% annually from 1970-71 to 1992-93)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MESTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A fibre crop that experienced a declining trend in its area share during both observed sub-periods)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUNHEMP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A fibre crop that showed a reversal in its area share, with a significant decline in the second sub-period)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TURMERIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A spice crop in Bihar that initially lost area but then increased at a rate of 4.19% per annum in the second sub-period)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHILLIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A major spice crop that gained area in the first sub-period but saw a decline in the second)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUGARCANE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A crop that significantly gained in its share of the gross cropped area during the second sub-period)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOBACCO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A crop that showed gains in area during both sub-periods, with a higher gain in the second)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India dominant in foodgrains production and experiencing shifts in crop area distribution)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUTE<|>BIHAR<|>Jute was a major fibre crop in Bihar, showing significant area gains<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MESTA<|>BIHAR<|>Mesta, as a fibre crop, experienced a declining trend in Bihar<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUNHEMP<|>BIHAR<|>Sunhemp's area share declined in Bihar, especially in the second sub-period<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TURMERIC<|>BIHAR<|>Turmeric, a spice crop, reversed its declining trend in Bihar in the second sub-period<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHILLIES<|>BIHAR<|>Chillies gained area in the first sub-period but declined in the second in Bihar<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUGARCANE<|>BIHAR<|>Sugarcane's share of the gross cropped area increased significantly in Bihar during the second sub-period<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOBACCO<|>BIHAR<|>Tobacco saw area gains in both sub-periods in Bihar, with a higher gain in the second<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
