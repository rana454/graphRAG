Increase:\nBarley: 1.89%\nArhar: 1.00%\nGram: 1.35%\nNigerseed: 1.74%\nJute: 1.65%\ne) Land Use Pattern\nThe study revealed the following broad conclusions in respect of the trend in land use pattern:\ni) Availability of Land for Agriculture:\nRelatively low in the state at 62.50%, compared to 86.70% in Punjab and 68.10% in Uttar Pradesh.\nDeclined from 65.9% in 1970-71 to 62.5% in 1990-91.\nii) Net Sown Area:\nLess at 45.26%, with a declining trend (-0.79%) during 1971-93.\nShrinkage due to expanding area under miscellaneous tree crops (1.70%) and land under non-agricultural use (0.47%).\niii) Declining Trend in Net Sown Area:\nUniform across different agro-climatic zones, relatively more in the plateau districts (-1.44%).\niv) Rate of Decline in Net Sown Area:\nSitamarhi: (-1.47%) in the north-west plains\nMunger: (-3.47%) in the east plains\nSanthal Parganas: (-1.83%)\nRanchi: (-1.89%)\nGiridih: (-1.70%) in the plateau zone\nThe decline in net sown area was clearly visible in increasing current fallow, barren land, land under miscellaneous tree crops, and land under non-agricultural use.\nv) High Rate of Decline in Current Fallow:\nGopalganj, Siwan, West Champaran: North-west\nMunger: East\nNalanda, Nawadah: South-west\nDhanbad, Hazaribagh: Plateau\nvi) Increasing Trend in Area Under Barren Land:\nDarbhanga, East Champaran, Sitamarhi, Vaishali: North-west\nAurangabad, Rohtas: South-west\nDhanbad: Plateau zone\nvii) Cropping Intensity:\nRemained stagnant at around 135% in Bihar.\nSignificant decline in gross cropped area observed across all agro-climatic zones, more prominently in the plateau zones.\nMadhubani and Sitamarhi: North-west\nMunger: East\nAurangabad and Gaya: South-west\nRanchi, Santhal Parganas, and Giridih: Plateau zone\nf) Trends and Pattern of Growth in Input Use\nFertilizer\ni) Fertilizer Consumption:\nIncreased significantly from 9.06 kg/ha. in 1970-71 to 57.2 kg/ha. in 1992-93.\nStill lagged behind states like Punjab (162.2 kg/ha.), Haryana (107 kg/ha.), Uttar Pradesh (86.0 kg/ha.), and all-India average (67.1 kg/ha.).\nii) Consumption by Zone:\nRelatively high in the south-west (87.36 kg/ha.) and low in the plateau (25.66 kg/ha.) zone.\nComparable to agriculturally developed states in districts such as Patna (135.86 kg/ha.), Nalanda (116.74 kg/ha.), Nawadah (92.71 kg/ha.), Begusarai (103.62 kg/ha.), and Bhojpur (87.98 kg/ha.).\niii) Fertilizer Use and Yield:\nHigh in zones/districts showing higher yield levels.\nPositive elasticity of foodgrains yield to fertilizer use and elasticity of fertilizer use to irrigation.\n\n\nComposition of Fertilizer Use\niv) Composition of fertilizer use in the State was unbalanced, more in favour of nitrogen (67.5%) and deficient in phosphorous (22.5%) and potash (10.0%). Across different agro-climatic zones, unbalanced use of fertiliser was more in the south-west plains showing high foodgrains production, irrigation network and fertilizer consumption. Districts with excessive share of nitrogen (above 85.0%) included Muzaffarpur and Vaishali in the north-west; Munger and Bhagalpur in the east; and Bhojpur, Gaya, Nalanda, Nawadah, Patna and Rohtas in the south-west plains.\nv) The adverse impact of excessive use of nitrogen on yield of foodgrains was clearly observed in different agro-climatic zones/districts as elasticity of foodgrains yield to nutrient ratio index was negative.\nIrrigation\nvi) With only around 43.0% of net irrigated area, the coverage of irrigation was low in the State when compared with the vast irrigation potential that the State is endowed with. Compared to states like Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, it was much less.\nvii) Of the several sources of irrigation, tubewells followed by canal dominated in the State. Tubewell irrigation alone showed increasing trend while all other sources, including canal, were declining.\nviii) Across different agro-climatic zones/districts, the south-west plain was relatively more irrigated (81.14%).
