Gross sown area in the State is 79.46 lakh hectares, while net sown area is 56.03 lakh hectares. There are around 1.04 crore landholdings in the State, of which around 83 percent are marginal holdings of size less than 1 hectare (Table 2.1). With around 90 percent of the total population living in rural areas, agriculture as the primary feeder of the rural economy continues to operate not only on margins of land but also on the margins of human enterprise, its productivity being among the lowest in the country. Without increasing returns to these margins, not much can be done realistically to develop the agricultural sector. Thus, agriculture continues to define both the potentialities and constraints to development in Bihar.\nAgriculture in Bihar is crucially dependent on the monsoon. Although around 57 percent of its gross cultivated area is irrigated, irrigation itself is crucially dependent on the monsoon as it largely depends on the use of surface water. According to the soil quality and climatic conditions of the relevant areas, Bihar has been classified into 3 agro-climatic zones: North-West Alluvial Plain (Zone 1), North-East Alluvial Plain (Zone 2), and South Alluvial Plain (Zone 3), with the last zone being further classified into two sub-zones 3A and 3B (Table 2.2). Monsoon arrives earliest in the north-eastern Zone 2, which also receives the highest rainfall among all three zones. Zone 3 receives monsoon showers last of all three zones and also the least amount. Total irrigated area in the State is 45.67 lakh hectares, of which nearly 30 percent is fed by canal water. This highlights the monsoon dependence of even irrigated lands as catchment areas of nearly all the major rivers in the State are outside the state.\n2.2 Agricultural Production in 2006-07\nKharif 2006 started with a probability of normal rainfall, but the deviation for the first showers of the monsoon was (-)48 percent. Rainfall in the month of June and July was normal, but was again below normal by 57 percent in August. It was again normal in the month of September. Finally, rainfall was 19 percent below normal for the entire monsoon. This seems to have adversely affected the area under cultivation. Area under paddy in the State according to the second advance estimate for Kharif 2006 was 31.30 lakh hectares (Table 2.3) against the target of 37.00 lakh hectares (Table 2.4). Similarly, area under wheat for Rabi 2006 stood at 20.34 lakh hectares, falling short of a target of 24.00 lakh hectares. Thus, there has been a fall in the area under foodgrains from 65.48 lakh hectares in 2005-06 to 61.55 lakh hectares in 2006-07 (Table 2.5). Under the conditions of deficient rainfall and a fall in acreage, foodgrain output is expected to register a fall over the figures for 2005-06. The second advance estimate of foodgrains for 2006-07 is 82.10 lakh MT. For Kharif 2006-07, foodgrain production has been estimated at 40.04 lakh MT over an area of 34.83 lakh hectares. For Rabi 2006-07, the estimate of foodgrain production is 42.06 lakh MT over an area of 26.73 lakh hectares. This is a fall of around 4 lakh MT from the previous year’s production of around 86 lakh MT. The effect of falling acreage on the production of foodgrains has, however, been moderated by an increase in yield from 12.39 qnts/hectare in 2005-06 to 13.34 qntls/hectare in 2006-07 (Table 2.6).\nCereal production is expected to fall by almost 3 lakh MT to 78 lakh MT as compared to the previous year’s production of 81 lakh MT (Table 2.7). This fall largely comes from a reduction in acreage under cereals by almost 9 lakh hectares. Within cereals, the fall in production is largely caused by a decrease in maize output by almost around 4 lakh MT. Other coarse cereals too are estimated to register a marginal fall in both acreage and production. While both rice and wheat are estimated to suffer a minor fall in acreage, their production is likely to improve over the previous year due to an increase in productivity (Table 2.5).\nProduction of pulses is also expected to fall marginally by 0.75 lakh MT in 2006-07 despite an increase in productivity. This is because of a substantive fall in the area under pulses by around 2 lakh hectares compared to the previous year. Oilseed production is expected to suffer a marginal fall from 1.19 lakh MT in 2005-06 to 1.11 lakh MT in 2006-07 due to a marginal fall in both acreage and productivity. Sugarcane has been planted on an area of 1.43 lakh hectares, and its output is estimated to be 12.33 lakh MT.\n\n \n      2.3 Long-Term Trend in Foodgrains Production\nFoodgrain production in Bihar has shown high volatility, but there is\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>Bihar is a state in India with a total geographical area of 93.60 lakh hectares and a population of 82.9 million, with a significant portion of its economy based on agriculture)##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGRICULTURE IN BIHAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Agriculture is the primary feeder of the rural economy in Bihar, characterized by marginal holdings and low productivity, crucially dependent on the monsoon)##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONSOON<|>EVENT<|>The monsoon is a seasonal rain pattern crucial for agriculture in Bihar, affecting irrigation and agricultural productivity)##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORTH-WEST ALLUVIAL PLAIN<|>GEO<|>One of the agro-climatic zones in Bihar, classified based on soil quality and climatic conditions)##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORTH-EAST ALLUVIAL PLAIN<|>GEO<|>One of the agro-climatic zones in Bihar, receives the highest rainfall among all three zones)##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTH ALLUVIAL PLAIN<|>GEO<|>One of the agro-climatic zones in Bihar, receives the least amount of monsoon showers)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGRICULTURE IN BIHAR<|>MONSOON<|>Agriculture in Bihar is crucially dependent on the monsoon for irrigation and productivity<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>NORTH-WEST ALLUVIAL PLAIN<|>North-West Alluvial Plain is one of the agro-climatic zones in Bihar<|>5)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>NORTH-EAST ALLUVIAL PLAIN<|>North-East Alluvial Plain is one of the agro-climatic zones in Bihar<|>5)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>SOUTH ALLUVIAL PLAIN<|>South Alluvial Plain is one of the agro-climatic zones in Bihar<|>5)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NORTH-EAST ALLUVIAL PLAIN<|>MONSOON<|>North-East Alluvial Plain receives the highest rainfall among all zones in Bihar, showing its direct dependence on the monsoon<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOUTH ALLUVIAL PLAIN<|>MONSOON<|>South Alluvial Plain receives the least amount of monsoon showers, indicating its climatic conditions<|>8)<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
