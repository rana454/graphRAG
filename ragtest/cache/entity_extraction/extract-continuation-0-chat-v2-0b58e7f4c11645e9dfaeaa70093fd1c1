Significantly, there was a reversal in the increasing rate of population growth in the State since the eighties. It was projected at 940 lakh persons for 1995. It had a share of 10.21% of the country's population. Density of population was high at 497 persons per sq. km., only next to West Bengal (767 persons). The sex ratio was 911 females per thousand males as against 927 at the all-India level. Like the all-India trend, the sex ratio in Bihar also showed a declining trend. The number of persons in the economically active age group of 20-59 was close to the all-India average at 42.0% for males and 43.9% for females. However, it was much less in comparison to states such as Maharashtra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal. Further, the State continues to be predominantly rural in character with only 13.1% of the population living in urban conglomerations and 86.9% living in rural segments. In contrast, most of the major states such as Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu showed urban populations consisting of more than 30.0% of their population. A fairly large chunk of the population (22.2%) of the State belonged to Scheduled Caste/Tribe groups.\n\nix) Migration\n11.17 In terms of the volume of gross migration, the state of Bihar stood fifth (38.4 lakh persons) only next to West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh in 1981. However, the extent of gross migrants was not such that the state population could be characterized as highly migrating. Only 5.5% of the population were migrants. Moreover, it was on the decline from 6.0% in 1971 to 5.5% in 1981. The volume of gross migrants increased only marginally by 13.75% over 1971-81. Moreover, outmigrants outnumbered inmigrants by double the size in both periods, i.e., 1971 and 1981. While outmigrants constituted 3.6% of the State's population in 1981, inmigrants constituted only 1.9%. The size of outmigration in Bihar was high only next to Uttar Pradesh in the country. On the other hand, the flow of inmigration was much less in the State. Net migrants thus stood at 1,182 thousand persons in 1981. Increase in the flow of inmigrants and outmigrants has been almost similar at 13.2% and 14.1% respectively for the State over 1971-81.\n\nCHAPTER III\nGROWTH PERFORMANCE OF FOODGRAINS IN BIHAR\nTEMPORAL AND DISTRICT-WISE ANALYSIS\n\ni) Production\n111.2 Table III.1 presents area, production, and yield of foodgrains for intermittent years from 1970-71 to 1992-93 in Bihar. Based on this data, the index number of area, production, and yield with 1970-71 as the base has also been constructed and presented in Table III.1. It is observed that up to 1982-83 there was stagnation in foodgrain production in Bihar with wide fluctuations from as low as 71 lakh tonnes in 1979-80 to as high as 99 lakh tonnes in 1980-81, a variation of 39.5% in the minimum and maximum production. However, the period from 1983-84 experienced increasing foodgrains production, reaching the level of 122 lakh tonnes in 1990-91. With 1970-71 as the base, the index number of foodgrains production reached 156 in 1990-91.\n111.3 The trend analysis of production of foodgrains for the period between 1970-71 and 1992-93 (Table III.2) suggests that during this period the foodgrains production was growing at a compound annual growth rate of 1.53% only. It was much less at 0.48% per annum during the first sub-period. The growth scenario of foodgrain production became more impressive during the second sub-period with a growth rate at 2.73% per annum. A close look at the physical data of production during 1984-93 clearly suggests that up to 1990-91 there was a continuous rise in the level of foodgrain production. But the subsequent years, i.e., 1991-92 and 1992-93, brought a significant reversal in production. Excluding these two years, the rate of growth in foodgrain production during 1984-91 worked at 4.70% per annum which was comparable to the growth rates experienced in agriculturally advanced states like Punjab (4.11%), Haryana (4.43%), and Uttar Pradesh (5.33%) during the same period.\n111.4 Analysis of foodgrains production across kharif and rabi season suggests that much of the increase in foodgrain production in Bihar was in rabi season alone, as production of foodgrains in kharif season remained stagnant. For example, the production of foodgrains in kharif season was 5472.43 thousand tonnes in 1980-83, which increased to 5805.73 thousand tonnes in 1990-93 in the state. It grew at 0.59% per annum only. On the other hand, production of foodgrains in rabi season increased from 3016.37 thousand tonnes in 1980-83 to 4882\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India with a population growth rate slightly lower than the national average, a high density of population, and a significant portion of its population living in rural areas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEST BENGAL<|>GEO<|>State in India with the highest population density next to Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHARASHTRA<|>GEO<|>One of the major states in India with a significant urban population and a reference point for comparison in migration and foodgrain production analysis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KERALA<|>GEO<|>State in India used for comparison in the context of population in the economically active age group)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAMIL NADU<|>GEO<|>State in India mentioned for its urban population percentage and as a comparison point in foodgrain production analysis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UTTAR PRADESH<|>GEO<|>State in India noted for having a high size of outmigration, second only to Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MADHYA PRADESH<|>GEO<|>State in India mentioned in the context of gross migration volume)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GUJARAT<|>GEO<|>State in India mentioned for its urban population percentage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KARNATAKA<|>GEO<|>State in India mentioned for its urban population percentage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUNJAB<|>GEO<|>State in India mentioned for comparison in the growth rate of foodgrain production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARYANA<|>GEO<|>State in India mentioned for comparison in the growth rate of foodgrain production)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>WEST BENGAL<|>Bihar has the second-highest population density next to West Bengal<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>MAHARASHTRA<|>Bihar and Maharashtra are compared in terms of migration and foodgrain production<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>UTTAR PRADESH<|>Bihar and Uttar Pradesh are compared in terms of outmigration size, with Uttar Pradesh having a higher size<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>GUJARAT<|>Bihar and Gujarat are contrasted in terms of urban population percentages<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>KARNATAKA<|>Bihar and Karnataka are contrasted in terms of urban population percentages<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>TAMIL NADU<|>Bihar and Tamil Nadu are compared in terms of urban population percentages and foodgrain production<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>KERALA<|>Bihar and Kerala are compared in terms of the population in the economically active age group<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>PUNJAB<|>Bihar's growth rate in foodgrain production is compared to Punjab's<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>HARYANA<|>Bihar's growth rate in foodgrain production is compared to Haryana's<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
