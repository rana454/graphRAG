He planted various fruit-bearing trees such as mango, guava, blackberry, jackfruit, wood apple, and vine fruit, along with wood-value trees. Singh received technical and scientific support and quality planting materials from KVK. Ensuring water availability for the trees was a major challenge due to the lack of a nearby water source. Singh purchased a motor-driven cart (locally referred to as Jharjhariya or Jugadgari) to transport water from a source located more than one kilometer away, which significantly helped resolve the water issue.\nCurrently, Singh owns a total of 564 fully grown trees on his barren land and adjacent forest department land. He earns approximately Rs 29,000 annually from fruit sales and Rs 33,000 from selling chopped wood. Every year, Singh trims 100 trees, selling the dry branches as wood and firewood. He also grows tomato and brinjal as a sharecropper on a close relative’s land, earning Rs 15,000 and Rs 4,000 per annum, respectively. His annual net income from poultry farming is approximately Rs 78,000. His total income, including earnings from the general store, cosmetic shop, and his sons’ online application form business, amounts to Rs 1.60 lakh per annum. Singh’s two sons contribute approximately Rs 47,000 annually to the family income. Looking forward, Singh plans to increase the number of trees to 1,000 by further plantation.\n10. Ajeet Kumar Singh\nAge: 28 years\nVenture: Para Vet Service Provider\nVillage: Rangabhitta\nPanchayat: Fala\nBlock: Pothia\nDistrict: Kishanganj\nEducational Qualification: Graduate\nInstitution Facilitating Venture: Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Kishanganj\nSkill Acquisition Brings Self-Employment Opportunity for Youth\nAfter graduating, Ajeet Kumar Singh was keen on securing a conventional job. Like the majority of youth his age, he wanted to avoid the uncertainties of unconventional jobs. However, destiny had something else in store for him. Unable to find a conventional source of employment, he was forced to address livelihood issues through self-employment.\nAcquiring skills related to para vet services, including artificial insemination, Singh established himself as a para vet service provider. He currently earns an average of Rs 1,30,000 annually by providing para vet services and has no regrets regarding his failure to secure a conventional job.\nTraining and Skill Development\nAn opportunity to participate in the Bihar Skill Development Mission (BSDM) training programme significantly helped Singh in establishing himself as a para vet service provider. The training programme was organized by Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), Kishanganj.\nPreviously, Singh had come in contact with KVK personnel through workshops on Rabi and Kharif crops organized by the agriculture department and district administration. Singh was invited to visit KVK and was informed about the latest advancements in agriculture, including BSDM training programmes. The KVK personnel explained that the primary objective of these programmes was to provide self-employment opportunities for youth.\nSingh joined the BSDM course on pesticide and fertilizer application at KVK and received a certificate upon successful completion. The course improved his farming practices by ensuring the proper use of pesticides, fertilizers, and seed treatment.\nPara Vet Services\nSingh was already involved in farming alongside assisting his father. He applied the knowledge from the BSDM course to his farming practices, leading to increased farm output. However, he sought additional income opportunities beyond farming.\nIn 2019, KVK scientists informed Singh about a training programme on artificial insemination conducted by ASCI under the skill development programme. Singh registered for the course and received a certificate of participation upon completion.\nEncouraged by KVK, Singh started providing artificial insemination services in his village and surrounding villages. He now serves over 40 villages in 22 panchayats, offering preliminary treatment for cattle and goats, vaccination services, and tagging.\nIncome and Future Goals\nSingh's income has increased significantly with the diversification of his services. He continues to stay in touch with KVK personnel to keep updated on skill development opportunities and aims for further skill development as a para vet service provider.\n\n11.

After graduating in 2012, he sought conventional employment and secured a job as a collection agent in 2015. However, dissatisfaction with his job led him to quit in 2017.\nStarting the Plant Business\nWhile exploring alternative livelihood opportunities, Thakur decided to start a plant business. Motivated by a relative involved in plantation work, he invested Rs 15,000 to purchase plants and began door-to-door selling. Despite initial losses, he persevered and expanded his business to include the supply of bay leaf and litchi plants.\nBusiness Expansion\nThakur diversified his business to include decorative plants and kitchen garden plants, building a working capital of Rs 70,000. His significant success came from selling Erica Palm, a decorative plant, which has helped him build a substantial working capital.\nEstablishing Nursery\nIn 2018, Thakur leased eight Katha of land in his village for Rs 12,\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>KRISHI VIGYAN KENDRA, KISHANGANJ<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Institution facilitating various agricultural and self-employment ventures, including training and skill development programs for youth in Kishanganj)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AJEET KUMAR SINGH<|>PERSON<|>A graduate who became a para vet service provider in Rangabhitta, earning an average of Rs 1,30,000 annually after training with KVK)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MANISH KUMAR THAKUR<|>PERSON<|>A graduate who started a plant nursery business in Phulwari, Kishanganj, with significant success in selling Erica Palm and other plants)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KISHANGANJ<|>GEO<|>District in which the Krishi Vigyan Kendra operates and where Ajeet Kumar Singh and Manish Kumar Thakur have their ventures)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR SKILL DEVELOPMENT MISSION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Organization that offers training programs aimed at skill development and self-employment opportunities for youth)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AJEET KUMAR SINGH<|>KRISHI VIGYAN KENDRA, KISHANGANJ<|>Ajeet Kumar Singh received training and support from KVK, Kishanganj, which helped him establish as a para vet service provider<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MANISH KUMAR THAKUR<|>KRISHI VIGYAN KENDRA, KISHANGANJ<|>Manish Kumar Thakur received motivation and possibly support from KVK, Kishanganj, for his plant nursery business<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AJEET KUMAR SINGH<|>BIHAR SKILL DEVELOPMENT MISSION<|>Ajeet Kumar Singh participated in a BSDM training program organized by KVK, which helped him in his venture<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KISHANGANJ<|>KRISHI VIGYAN KENDRA, KISHANGANJ<|>KVK, Kishanganj operates within the Kishanganj district, facilitating ventures and training programs<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
