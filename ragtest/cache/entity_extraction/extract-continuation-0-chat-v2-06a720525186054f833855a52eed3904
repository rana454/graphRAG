The performance of the varieties has also helped in bringing more areas (30%) under the varieties with profitability of nearly 30 percent.\nSizeable marginal and barren land in the districts of Dhanbad, Bokaro, Giridih, Latehar, Lohardaga, Saraikela, East & West Singhbhum, Godda, Gumla, Hazaribag, and Ranchi could be brought under Niger cultivation by the KVKs with the introduction of varieties BN-1, JNC-6, and Puja. Nearly 10-12 percent of the existing barren land is now occupied through Niger cultivation with increased productivity and profitability to the extent of 45-50 and 20 percent, respectively.\n\nLac Cultivation\nLac rearing and cultivation is a traditional occupation and an important source of income for thousands of poor tribal families. However, the potential of lac cultivation has not yet been tapped to provide the desired benefit to the tribal. The KVKs of Jharkhand have introduced lac cultivation technology including improved breeds of Rangini and Kusumi, insect-pest and disease management, processing, etc., in the districts of Palamu, Lohardaga, Chatra, Bokaro, Saraikela, East Singhbhum, and Gumla. The KVKs also imparted training to lac rearers and exposed them to scientific lac cultivation practices at IINRG, Ranchi. The efforts of the KVKs helped the tribal farmers enhance profitability to the extent of 60 percent with the adoption of scientific practices.\n\nMulti-Layer Vegetable Cropping System\nFarmers of the Nipania village (Godda Block) have been cultivating cucurbits since long by making a structure of bamboo and thread (locally called machan) during the rainy season to spread the vines. In this way, the land below the machan was lying vacant. GVT-KVK, Godda has demonstrated the cultivation of Elephant Foot Yam (EFY) (var.-Gajendra-1) below the multilayer (EFY+Bitter gourd). Three cucurbits viz. ridge gourd, bottle gourd, and bitter gourd were grown along with EFY. The maximum C\nRatio of 1:4.1 was recorded in the case of EFY+bitter gourd, while in the case of sole cropping of bitter gourd it was only 1:1.6. This technology has spread across 16 acres in the district.\n\nProtein Security Through Pulse Cultivation on Bund\nAdoption of practices like the selection of a short-duration variety of pigeon pea (var.-Nirmal-2), quality seeds, and optimum crop geometry (60x20 cm) under a paired row system has been demonstrated by GVT-KVK, Godda due to the prevalence of low land in Godda Block. Pigeon pea cultivation was difficult because of water logging in the main field. Therefore, the demonstration was conducted to grow pigeon pea on the bund of rice fields. Presently, about 1025 ha of land has been brought under this type of cultivation. Pigeon pea sown on the bund of the rice field, with a seed rate (1 kg/ha), resulted in good plant population, seed yield (96 kg/ha), straw yield (5.2 q/ha), and a net profit of Rs 6620/ha. Besides, the net profit, it has been found useful to fulfill the need for pulses for household consumption, fuel, and compost. It also serves as fencing against grazing animals.\n\nIntercropping of Mango-Based Sugar Cane\nGenerally, farmers do not take any type of crops in the orchard in our district. During the training programs, KVK Godda has suggested taking intercrops in the space between mango plants to get additional yield from the orchard. It has been observed that during the 1st year of orchard establishment, the LER was approximately 1, while it was about 1.2 in the 4th year of the orchard, and after 8 years, it was about 1.4. The space utilized by the mango plant after 8 years is 35%, and the rest of the area is covered by sugar cane. In a sole mango orchard, the total yield of mango fruit was obtained at 85 q/ha, while in the case of intercropping with sugar cane, the yield of mango fruit was recorded at 92 q/ha due to regular application of manuring and watering. Besides the mango crop, the farmer also harvested 482 quintals of sugar cane in one hectare area. Presently, more than 1000 acres of newly established mango orchards are intercropped with sugar cane.\n\nOther Initiatives by the KVKs of Bihar and Jharkhand\nBrown Manuring\nPre-germinated paddy seed (@25 kg/ha) was broadcast along with sesbania (@30 kg/ha) in soil after giving one shallow ploughing. One-fourth of 75% recommended N (80 kg/ha) and 75% recommended P and K (40 kg/ha) were applied as basal. No herbicide was used before sowing. Half of the 75% recommended N was applied 45 days after sowing (DAS), and the rest was applied at 70 DAS. Herbicide 2,4-diethyl ester was applied two times, one after\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BOKARO<|>GEO<|>A district in Jharkhand showing increased productivity due to new agricultural practices)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DHANBAD<|>GEO<|>A district in Jharkhand involved in Niger cultivation and showing increased agricultural productivity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOHARDAGA<|>GEO<|>A district in Jharkhand where lac cultivation technology has been introduced)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LATEHAR<|>GEO<|>A district in Jharkhand participating in Niger cultivation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEST SINGHBHUM<|>GEO<|>A district in Jharkhand with increased agricultural productivity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GIRIDIH<|>GEO<|>A district in Jharkhand involved in Niger cultivation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PALAMU<|>GEO<|>A district in Jharkhand where lac cultivation technology has been introduced)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAHIBGANJ<|>GEO<|>A district in Jharkhand with increased agricultural productivity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUMKA<|>GEO<|>A district in Jharkhand showing increased agricultural productivity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RANCHI<|>GEO<|>Capital of Jharkhand, involved in various agricultural initiatives)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GARHWA<|>GEO<|>A district in Jharkhand with increased agricultural productivity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAZARIBAG<|>GEO<|>A district in Jharkhand involved in Niger cultivation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GODDA<|>GEO<|>A district in Jharkhand pioneering in multi-layer vegetable cropping and pulse cultivation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GUMLA<|>GEO<|>A district in Jharkhand where lac cultivation technology has been introduced)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KODERMA<|>GEO<|>A district in Jharkhand showing increased agricultural productivity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KVK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Krishi Vigyan Kendra, involved in agricultural research and development across Jharkhand and Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IINRG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Indian Institute of Natural Resins and Gums, Ranchi, where training on scientific lac cultivation practices is imparted)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NIPANIA VILLAGE<|>GEO<|>A village in Godda Block where multi-layer vegetable cropping system is demonstrated)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GVT-KVK, GODDA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A Krishi Vigyan Kendra in Godda, involved in demonstrating innovative agricultural practices)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOHARDAGA<|>KVK<|>KVK introduced lac cultivation technology in Lohardaga<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GODDA<|>GVT-KVK, GODDA<|>GVT-KVK, Godda, has demonstrated various agricultural practices in Godda district<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NIPANIA VILLAGE<|>GVT-KVK, GODDA<|>GVT-KVK, Godda, demonstrated the cultivation of Elephant Foot Yam in Nipania Village<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RANCHI<|>IINRG<|>IINRG, located in Ranchi, provides training on scientific lac cultivation<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
