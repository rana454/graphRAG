Just as for other Indian states, Bihar has 95 regulated markets (mandis), 67 principal market yards, and 855 rural haats that handle some of the marketing of major agricultural commodities in the state. They are supervised and controlled by the State Agriculture Produce Marketing Board under the provisions of the Bihar State Agriculture Produce Marketing Act (1960). Data on market arrivals indicate that a very small share of agricultural production finds its way to the markets. This is because (a) the amount and quality of market infrastructure and support services is poor, and (b) the transportation costs and informal transaction costs discourage farmers from going to the markets.\n\nA recent study shows that the quality and quantity of marketing outlets in Bihar are among the worst in the country. Furthermore, a World Bank analysis of some commodity supply chains has shown that up to 40 percent of the margins along with value chains are lost to wastage and transportation costs. Crop diversification, especially into the relatively more perishable fruits and vegetables, will increase the need for effective marketing linkages supported by modern marketing practices, including the introduction of grading, post-harvest management, cold chains, etc.\n\nStandard quality grades for fruits and vegetables are currently not used in Bihar. Few standards are used for milk, fat content, and some other products. Some processing plants are HACCP and ISO certified. The Patna (Bihar) laboratory of the Directorate of Marketing and Inspection (responsible for quality certification of agricultural products under the “AgMark” scheme) ceased its operations at the end of 2006 due to the lack of demand for its services. The Directorate (under the Department of Agriculture and Cooperation, Government of India) has 23 Agmark laboratories that processors can approach for voluntary certification of quality and the right to display the AgMark Stamp. Of the 13,000 grading units that exist in the country, only 3 are situated in Bihar. The total value of produce that gets graded is negligible, unlike in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu, where the share of the value of graded produce is as high as 75 percent of the national value.\n\nThere are significant post-harvest losses. Every year, substantial losses are incurred amongst perishable products. It is estimated that as much as 39 percent of tomatoes produced in the State is wasted. Similarly, 39 percent of mangoes and 22 percent of litchis production are lost annually due to a lack of proper post-harvest activities and facilities (World Bank, 2004).\n\nIt is recognized that a considerable share of agriculture production in Bihar is being produced for home consumption, thus lowering the marketable surplus. There are also some other important factors that prohibit producers from accessing the markets. One of the most important issues in this respect is the non-remunerative price structure. As discussed elsewhere in this report, the cost of production of various crops is much higher than the Minimum Support Price offered. Added to that is the weak marketing infrastructure. In a recent World Bank study (2004), Bihar ranked third from bottom amongst states in the level and quality of its regulated marketing infrastructure. It also came fourth to the last in the level of farmers’ satisfaction with existing market conditions. Bihar’s density of markets (per million hectares of sown area) is relatively low. There are 7 principal regulated markets for every million ha of area in Bihar compared to 22 in the neighboring state of Andhra Pradesh.\n\nIt is encouraging to note that the Bihar Eleventh Plan recognizes the role of private investment to help in the development of marketing infrastructure. This will help promote contract farming, export of fresh and processed fruits, processing of ethanol, corn oil, in the feed and starch industry, export of baby corn, and to make litchi honey.\n\nFinally, the number of wholesale markets in the state is also not adequate, and for the disposal of agricultural produces, the farmers are required to travel a long distance. Nearly 400 sq. km area in the state is served by each wholesale market as against 156 sq. km in Punjab and 318 sq. km in West Bengal. As many of the small and marginal farmers cannot cover such a long distance, they usually dispose of their produces to the village itinerary traders. To conclude, the Infrastructure Development Index is 80 for Bihar, benchmarked against 100 for all India.\n\nORGANIC AGRICULTURE\nIncreasing awareness about the health hazards caused by excessive use of agro-chemicals has brought a major shift in customer sensibilities and preference towards food quality in developed countries. In India, soil erosion and salinity problems, compounded with the ever-rising cost of cultivation caused by excessive agrochemicals and irrigation, have made cultivators look for alternative strategies. Globally, the demand for safe and healthy food is on the rise. Global consumers are increasingly looking forward to organic food that is considered to be safe and hazard-free. The global market for organic food is expected to touch US $40 billion by 2010. The demand is ever-increasing both in developing as well as developed countries. Worldwide, over 130 countries produce certified organic products in commercial quantities.\nConcept of Organic Farming\nOrganic agriculture is primarily defined as a production system which is supportive of the environment. Organic production systems are based on specific standards precisely formulated for food production and aim at achieving systems that are socially and ecologically sustainable. The use of chemical synthetic fertilizers and pesticides is avoided. The focus in organic agriculture is to provide toxin-free food for the customer and the farmer growing it using organic inputs. Organic agriculture is a process that imparts sustenance and minimizes the ecological footprint.\n\n“Organic” denotes a label for products that have been produced in accordance with certain standards during food production, handling, processing, marketing stages, and certified by a duly constituted certification body or authority. The organic label is therefore a process claim rather than\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India with a significant agricultural sector, facing challenges in market infrastructure and post-harvest losses)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STATE AGRICULTURE PRODUCE MARKETING BOARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Supervises and controls the regulated markets in Bihar under the Bihar State Agriculture Produce Marketing Act)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WORLD BANK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Conducted analysis and studies indicating significant post-harvest losses and inefficiencies in Bihar's agricultural supply chains)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIRECTORATE OF MARKETING AND INSPECTION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Responsible for quality certification of agricultural products under the AgMark scheme in India)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PATNA<|>GEO<|>Capital city of Bihar, where the laboratory of the Directorate of Marketing and Inspection ceased operations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHARASHTRA<|>GEO<|>Indian state mentioned as having a high share of the value of graded produce)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UTTAR PRADESH<|>GEO<|>Indian state mentioned as having a high share of the value of graded produce)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAMIL NADU<|>GEO<|>Indian state mentioned as having a high share of the value of graded produce)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANDHRA PRADESH<|>GEO<|>Neighboring state of Bihar, mentioned for its higher density of markets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORGANIC AGRICULTURE<|>EVENT<|>The shift towards organic farming in India due to health hazards from excessive use of agro-chemicals)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>STATE AGRICULTURE PRODUCE MARKETING BOARD<|>The State Agriculture Produce Marketing Board operates under the Bihar State Agriculture Produce Marketing Act to manage Bihar's agricultural markets<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>WORLD BANK<|>The World Bank has conducted studies and provided analysis on Bihar's agricultural sector<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DIRECTORATE OF MARKETING AND INSPECTION<|>PATNA<|>The Directorate had a laboratory in Patna for quality certification which ceased operations<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>ORGANIC AGRICULTURE<|>Bihar is part of the shift towards organic agriculture in response to the global demand for safe and healthy food<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
