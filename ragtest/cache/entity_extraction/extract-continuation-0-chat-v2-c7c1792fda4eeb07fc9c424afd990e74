It would be better to avail of the readily available experience with a view to adapt that in keeping with the ground situation in Bihar. If above points are addressed, there is no reason for Bihar not to be able to condense the 30 years of development activity of Punjab to 10 years. It can then surely catch up with the present productivity levels of rice and wheat in Punjab and other cherished goals in maize, pulses, oilseeds, horticulture and livestock production in the next two five-year Plans. Fortunately for Bihar, the State has trained agricultural labour from Punjab. The Bihari labour which was responsible for the first Green Revolution of Punjab will now provide the momentum for the Second Green Revolution in their home State. Thus, there is a need for awakening with commitment to convert the weaknesses into opportunities and revamp agriculture which is a sole source of economic development. Bihar also needs to put a special focus on system of organic farming in the light of experiences available in India. This would bring faster results for increased productivity.\n(xiii) Financial Implications\nPoor rural infrastructure, outdated farm level delivery mechanism and lack of implementation\ncapacity, and a very low level of financial allocations through Five Year Plans have been the main reasons for low farm productivity and general poverty and unemployment in rural Bihar. If Bihar has to prosper, it is only by means of sustained agricultural growth. Therefore, in order to\nimplement the thrust of the proposed strategies and policies, Bihar would require a substantially\nhigher level of financial outlays during next 5-6 years (2008-09 to 2012-13). This is estimated at\nRs.27,055 crores. The current plan (11th Five Year) outlays for Bihar’s agriculture is Rs.1,698\ncrores, which is very meager. This would not only help Bihar in emerging a food surplus state but also help India from the emerging crisis of food insecurity. It would then be possible for India to realize its goal of 9-10% annual GDP. Thus, both Bihar and India would move towards the path of sustained economic development.\nTal, Diara, and Chaur Lands\nIn the south of the natural levee of the Ganga, there is a vast stretch of backwaters known as “Tal (low order monsoon stream)” lands extending from Buxar to Pakur where most of the rivers and rivulets coming from the south get lost. The estimated area under “Tals” is about 1.00 lakh ha. In addition to the Tal lands, the state has about 4 lakh ha of ‘Diara lands (saucer-shaped flood plain of a river)’ under the flood plains of rivers Ganga and Ghaghara. The state also has about 4 lakh ha of ‘Chaur lands (remnants of river course)’, which are highly suitable for fish farming. The Tal, Diara, and Chaur lands are inundated by water for varying periods and are difficult to manage.\nLand Utilization Pattern\nAbout 61.18% of the newly organized State is under cultivation as per the figures available for the year 2002-03. The percentage of fallow land in the same year is 6.75%. The corresponding figure for undivided Bihar prior to bifurcation was 42.77% and 16.02% respectively. Consequent upon the bifurcation of the State, forest area has dwindled to a meager 6.65% from 17.01%. The forest coverage thus compares very unfavorably with the national average which stands at around 26%. The Gross and net sown area in the State is 80.26 lakh ha and 56.38 lakh ha respectively. The intensity of cropping is 142%.\nDistribution of Operational Holdings\nAs 77% of the state’s main workforce is employed in the agricultural sector, the average size of operational holdings in Bihar is only 0.75 hectare as against the national average of 1.41 hectare (Govt. of India, 2005). The share of marginal holdings having less than 1 hectare each is as much as 82.9% (Annexure II). Also, marginal and small holdings account for about 59.8% of the total operated area.\nFloods and Droughts\nEvery year, Bihar faces the vagaries of flood and waterlogging. The total flood-prone area of the State is 68.80 lakh hectares, which is 73.06% of its total geographical area and 17.2% of the total flood-prone area in the country. A substantial proportion of the total cropped area (nearly 41%) gets frequently affected by floods. Flood situation is most severe in the northern plains of Bihar. This is because almost all the major rivers in the State enter Bihar from Nepal in this region. The bed slope of these rivers is very sharp in Nepal, and they usually enter the State on plain lands. Because of the sudden drop in bed slope, silt brought by the flow of these rivers gets deposited at their base and causes recurring floods (Annexure III).\nIt is a sad story that almost 100% of the gross cropped area in the districts of Araria, Muzaffarpur, Sheohar and 50 to 75% area in Begusarai, Katihar, Sheikhpura, and Sitamarhi is flood-prone. It has been estimated that during the kharif season, about 23% of paddy area remains waterlogged where the adoption of modern technology is either nil or low and consequently, the crop yields are low.\nSimilarly, there are frequent\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India facing challenges in agriculture, aiming for higher productivity levels and economic development through agriculture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUNJAB<|>GEO<|>State in India known for its successful Green Revolution, providing trained agricultural labor to Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDIA<|>GEO<|>Country aiming to overcome food insecurity and achieve a high annual GDP growth through agricultural development)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAL LANDS<|>GEO<|>Low order monsoon stream lands extending from Buxar to Pakur in Bihar, difficult to manage due to water inundation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIARA LANDS<|>GEO<|>Saucer-shaped flood plain lands under the flood plains of rivers Ganga and Ghaghara in Bihar, suitable for agriculture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHAUR LANDS<|>GEO<|>Remnants of river course in Bihar, highly suitable for fish farming)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GANGA<|>GEO<|>Major river in India, contributing to the flood plains and agricultural lands in Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GHAGHARA<|>GEO<|>River contributing to the flood plains and agricultural lands in Bihar)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>PUNJAB<|>Bihar receives trained agricultural labor from Punjab for its agricultural development<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>INDIA<|>Bihar's agricultural development is crucial for India's goal to overcome food insecurity and achieve high GDP growth<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TAL LANDS<|>BIHAR<|>Tal lands are a significant part of Bihar's geography, affecting its agriculture and management of water resources<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DIARA LANDS<|>GANGA<|>Diara lands are located in the flood plains of the Ganga river in Bihar, affecting agriculture<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHAUR LANDS<|>BIHAR<|>Chaur lands in Bihar are highly suitable for fish farming, contributing to the state's agricultural diversity<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GANGA<|>BIHAR<|>The Ganga river's flood plains significantly impact Bihar's agriculture and land use<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GHAGHARA<|>BIHAR<|>The Ghaghara river contributes to the flood plains and agricultural lands in Bihar<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
