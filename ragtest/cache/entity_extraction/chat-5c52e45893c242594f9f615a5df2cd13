The identified challenges have been mapped to interventions required to address them. Some of the suggested interventions are already included as part of the existing activities proposed under the agriculture roadmap, while the remaining activities will be taken up separately by the department.\n\n\n\nSoil and Water Conservation Program\nIntroduction\nConservation of natural resources like soil and water plays an important role in the development of agriculture in an agricultural state like Bihar. Due to climate change and an increase in global temperature, irregularity in the timing and quantity of rains and a decrease in rainfall have been observed in recent years. The per capita availability of water is decreasing every year, which, coupled with a rapidly growing population and increasing needs of a developing state, is affecting agricultural productivity. Additionally, the continuous decline in ground water levels due to dependence on groundwater for irrigation further compounds the issue. Therefore, there is a need to promote and strengthen activities related to water conservation and water use management in the state by adopting a holistic and integrated approach.\nThe districts of southern Bihar are dominated by barren land, and farmers mainly depend on monsoon for irrigation. In these rain-fed areas, water scarcity, rapid decline in groundwater levels, and significant soil erosion are prevalent. Evaporation is also high due to elevated temperatures. Thus, sufficient water availability for farming is a concern. The problem of soil erosion is acute in southern Bihar, with fertile soil being washed away with rainwater into river drains. Maintaining agricultural productivity without adopting soil and water conservation techniques seems impossible.\nTo address these issues, the Directorate of Soil Conservation, Agriculture Department, and Bihar Watershed Development Society are implementing various schemes in 18 districts: Banka, Munger, Jamui, Nawada, Gaya, Aurangabad, Rohtas, Kaimur, Lakhisarai, Sheikhpura, Nalanda, Patna, Jehanabad, Arwal, Bhojpur, Bhagalpur, Buxar, and Begusarai. These schemes include:\n* Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana - Watershed Development Component\n* Construction of pucca check dams up to 30 feet under Saat Nischay-2\n* Soil and Water Conservation Schemes under the State Plan\nActivities under these schemes include land levelling, field bunding, check dam construction, pond construction, ahar-pyne renovation, silt detention dams, and community irrigation wells. Adoption of these technologies has proven effective in maintaining field water and soil. The Watershed Development Programme for natural resource conservation, especially soil and water, has been successful, incorporating multi-level methods from ridge to valley, community participation, capacity building, and promoting livelihood and productivity systems.\nBrief Achievements of the Last Three Agricultural Road Maps\nUnder the last three agricultural road maps (2007-2023), the Directorate of Soil Conservation and Bihar Watershed Development Society implemented various schemes in 17 districts: Banka, Munger, Jamui, Nawada, Gaya, Aurangabad, Rohtas, Kaimur, Lakhisarai, Sheikhpura, Nalanda, Patna, Jehanabad, Arwal, Bhojpur, Bhagalpur, and Buxar. The schemes included:\n* Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana - Watershed Development\n* Construction of pucca check dams up to 30 feet in Saat Nischay-2\n* Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (Per Drop More Crop)\n* Green Revolution Scheme for Eastern India under RKVY\n* Soil and Water Conservation Schemes under the State Plan\nA total of 64 projects were successfully implemented under the Integrated Watershed Management Program (IWMP) Batch-III (2011-12) and Batch-IV (2012-13). This resulted in the treatment of 311,993 hectares in 8 districts of South Bihar: Aurangabad, Rohtas, Kaimur, Gaya, Nawada, Jamui, Munger, and Banka.\nAdditional achievements include:\n* Construction of 37,034 structures under various schemes, including:\n   * 10,297 water harvesting ponds of different sizes\n   * 6,964 ahar-pyne renovations\n   * 2,051 pucca check dams\n   * 722 community pond renovations\n   * 4,324 silt detention dams\n   * 979 earthen check dams\n   * Field bunding in 3,131 hectares\n   * 1,498 irrigation wells\n   * 7,068 other structures like continuous contour trench, staggered contour trench, private and community borewells, etc.\nA total of 80,206 hectares of additional irrigation potential has been created.
