Their secretive, enzymatic abilities canalize the available food into the food web, creating a buffer for absorbing stress and coordinating the nutritional requirements of crops and the whole ecosystem.\nAid in Correcting Imbalanced or Chemical-Affected Soils: In combination with organic amendments and procedural methods.\nMinimize the Use of Fungicides: The diversity of microbes helps in reducing the use of fungicides due to competition from freshly brewed active microbes for food and space on plant surfaces.\nEnable Addition of Fresh Microbes: KREF solution also enables the addition of fresh microbes at the rate of 20 liters per acre of fresh culture, which teems with healthy microbes. They start working instantaneously in soils and on leaves, allowing farmers to see results within 48 to 72 hours.\nMicrobes and Organic Farming\nThere are millions of microbes in a gram of soil, significant due to their prolific activities. Microbes literally control the process of organic farming as they govern nutrient cycling reactions in soils. They process organic matter to provide a balance of minerals and nutrients, which are utilized by plants for healthy, vigorous crop growth. Microbes also form a protective cover for plants and provide balance by preventing any one organism from dominating. They are basic indicators of soil fertility and are responsible for nutrient cycles.\nDemand for Microbial Inputs\nResearch identifies additional roles for microorganisms in soil. Commercially cultured microorganisms for use as agricultural inoculants have been available for more than 100 years and have significantly impacted agriculture. Organisms used as inoculants in soils typically include:\nNitrogen-fixing Bacteria: Including Rhizobium and Azotobacter.\nPhosphate-solubilizing Bacteria: Such as Bacillus, Aspergillus, and Penicillium.\nMycorrhizal Fungi: For improving nutrient uptake and promoting plant growth.\n\nCREDIT FACILITIES\nCredit is a critical input for the development of agriculture and allied activities. The key task is to ensure a convergence among credit availability, an effective credit delivery system in keeping with the adequate credit absorptive capacity of the farmer. Mere availability of credit does not ensure its productive use and increased production/value addition. This is more important in the case of small/marginal farmers who are quite often left out because of the clout of influential farmers.\nThough over the years there has been a significant improvement in the availability of institutional credit in the agriculture sector in the state, it is still considered to be inadequate and inefficient. As a result, farmers in Bihar are still heavily dependent on informal sources of credit at exorbitantly high rates of interest. The state of Bihar, which has a per capita income of Rs. 5,772 vis-à-vis a national per capita income of Rs. 23,222, is the poorest state in India. Out of the total branches of banks, 65% of the branches are in rural areas. Bank-wise rural branches are: Commercial Banks 59.6%, RRBs 86.5%, and Co-op Banks 17.66% of the total. There is a gross inadequate density of financial service access points in Bihar. Bihar has a total of 45,103 villages; this translates to one branch in every 13 villages based on the total branch estimates of 2006. This indicates that even to provide basic access to financial services, this is clearly insufficient. (Annexure-XXXIII)\nChallenges in Banking Services\nIn addition to the low density of branch presence, there is the added issue of the nature of services provided by the banking system as a whole. The extreme poverty level of the state is reflected in the aggregate deposit base. The average deposit per individual is only Rs. 55,000 against the national average of Rs. 1,95,000. The situation of advances is even worse for Regional Rural Banks and Cooperative Banks where the total amount of advances for the year 2005-06 is only Rs. 22,250 and Rs. 5,950 respectively. However, this trend is moving in a positive direction over the years. The Credit Deposit ratio in the state is also very poor compared to the national average. In the case of Commercial Banks and Regional Rural Banks, the CD Ratio in Bihar is 31 and 36 respectively. The performance of Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) also reflects a similar state. While there are almost 6,000 PACS in Bihar, only 19% of them posted a profit in the year 2004-05 compared to the national average of 43%.\nKisan Credit Card (KCC)\nKisan Credit Card (KCC) is another important medium for increasing agricultural credit. At present, there are 1.04 crore landholdings in the State, but till 2005-06, only 14.5 lakh KCCs have been distributed against the target of 30.5 lakhs. To meet the target of crop loans of Rs. 10,042 crore in 2006-07, KCCs have to play a very important role. Although total disbursement under KCC has increased almost 2.5 times, from Rs. 342 crore in 2002-03 to Rs. 815 crore in 2005-06, it still channels only a minuscule proportion of the total credit volume for crop loans.\nMicro-Finance Initiatives\nIn the area of micro-finance, more than 17,000 Self-Help Groups had been financed by banks up to\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
