Despite comparatively higher net profit in pulses production compared to wheat production, farmers prefer to cultivate wheat due to lower risk. Moreover, there is a dearth of promising and pest-disease-resistant varieties of pulses in Bihar. Maize is the only crop that has performed well in Bihar, particularly the introduced winter maize. Winter maize is produced mainly for market purposes, though price fluctuations are common.\nIn Bihar, the irrigated crop area (59%) is higher than the corresponding national average (42%), but the per hectare productivity of almost all crops is lower than the national average. Despite a comparatively high proportion of irrigated area, the majority of farmers are not in a position to irrigate their crops adequately and timely due to the collapse of the canal irrigation system.\nThe use of chemical fertilizers in Bihar (156 kg/ha) is higher than the national average (115 kg/ha), but farmers use imbalanced quantities of nitrogen (N), phosphate (P₂O₅), and potash (K), resulting in poor crop responses to these nutrients. Poor response to chemical fertilizers might be due to a deficiency of micronutrients, particularly zinc, manganese, and sulfur in the soil. Assimilation of principal elements (NPK) in the crop is restricted due to this factor. Farmers are unaware of the benefits of balanced use of fertilizers and the deficiency of micronutrients in the soil.\n\nROLE OF KVKs OF BIHAR IN TRAINING OF FARMERS AND FARM WOMEN, RURAL YOUTH, AND EXTENSION FUNCTIONARIES\nAs a mandated activity towards human resource development, the KVKs of Bihar organized 5630 training programmes for 177,412 beneficiaries, including practicing farmers, farm women, rural youths, and extension functionaries during 2012-13.\nFarmers and Farm Women Trained: 140,280\nCourses Offered: 4154\nIn providing training to rural youths, 952 courses were offered for the benefit of 22,281 participants, whereas 524 courses were organized for 14,851 extension functionaries.\nCaste-wise participation in the training programmes shows that 15.8% of the trainees were from the scheduled caste category. The analysis indicates that farmers of lower socio-economic status are increasingly approaching KVKs for their economic betterment through training. The major areas covered were integrated crop management, seed production, cropping system, integrated farming system, resource conservation technology, water management, nursery management, integrated pest management, rejuvenation of old orchards, gender mainstreaming through SHGs, integrated nutrient management, management of farm animals, livestock feed, and fodder production, etc. Both on-campus and off-campus courses were conducted by the KVKs as per the requirement of the clientele.\nFRONT LINE DEMONSTRATIONS\nIn the rabi season, 484 demonstrations on selected oilseeds were carried out by the KVKs for an area of 144 ha. In pulse crops, demonstrations were conducted in 291 ha with the participation of 928 farmers. In kharif, an area of 107 ha was brought under pulse crop demonstrations involving 346 farmers. In crops like paddy, wheat, vegetables, etc., 2838 demonstrations were conducted by the KVKs in 831 ha. The total number of beneficiaries was 4600 both in rabi and kharif seasons of 2012-13.\nSeed Replacement\nBihar agriculture is dominated by small landholders. About 96% of farm households have less than 2 ha of land and own 67% of agricultural land in Bihar. Marginal farmers constitute about 90% of total farm holdings and own about 43% of land in Bihar. The process of agricultural development among these farmers mostly lags behind as they do not have resources for the acquisition of modern agricultural technologies. Farmers have recently started using high-yielding varieties of seeds for principal crops like paddy, wheat, maize, pulses, oilseeds, and vegetables. However, the use of home-grown seeds by around two-thirds of the farmers is prevalent in Bihar. The state government, with the support of KVKs and state agricultural universities, has initiated an aggressive program for popularizing the use of quality seeds. This has resulted in the replacement of local cultivars in paddy to the extent of 30 to 35% through high-yielding varieties and 20 to 22% through hybrids. In wheat, 60 to 70% of local varieties have been replaced by high-yielding varieties, and in maize, 20 to 25% with composites. The most successful introduction has been observed in maize, which is expected to replace 90% of the local varieties through QPM. In pulses and oilseeds, the seed replacement rate was 25 to 30% during the year 2011-12, and in vegetables, 45 to 50%. Adoption of new technologies like the SRI method in wheat and rice, improved sugarcane cultivation methods, balanced doses of NPK, wheat management practices, and zero-tillage methods of sowing have significantly improved the average yield of crops.\nHORTICULTURE DEVELOPMENT\nBihar has an important place in the area and production of fruits and vegetables in India. The state’s share in the area under fruits and vegetables in the country is estimated at 8.5% (2005-06). The area under fruits and vegetables covers about 10% of the gross cropped area but generates income of about 50% of the total value of all crops produced in Bihar. Bihar has a monopoly in the production of litchi and makhana, producing 70% of the total litchi production and 80% of makhana in the country.
