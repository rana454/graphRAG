Other zones also showed wide fluctuations, as the coefficient of variation exceeded 20.0%. District-wise analysis suggested higher instability in sugarcane production in districts with relatively high increasing or high decreasing rates of growth. With specific reference to major sugarcane growing districts, it was observed that Gopalganj and West Champaran, both showing high increasing growth rates (4.46% and 2.80% respectively), had relatively high instability, with coefficients of variation at 43.77% and 31.38%, respectively. East Champaran, the other district where sugarcane production was large, showed relatively more stability with a coefficient of variation at 19.39% only.\nIV.7.8 Acceleration/Deceleration in Production\nAnalysis of acceleration/deceleration in the growth of sugarcane production in different zones/districts indicated that there was acceleration in the increasing growth rate in sugarcane production (0.84%) in the north-west plains. The declining trend in the production of sugarcane in other zones, namely the east, south-west, and plateau districts, showed an accentuation with rates of acceleration at 0.50%, 0.44%, and 0.05% in respective zones. Analyzing the pattern across districts of the north-west where production of sugarcane was relatively more, it is significant to observe that in all the three major sugarcane growing districts of the zone, viz. West Champaran, East Champaran, and Gopalganj, there was acceleration in the increasing trend rate of growth. There was acceleration in the increasing growth rate in respect of Sitamarhi and Siwan as well. Samastipur was the only district of the zone which showed deceleration in its increasing growth rate. The declining growth rates in respect of Vaishali (-6.52%), Saran (-0.80%), Madhubani (-0.71%), and Darbhanga (-2.57%) showed to accelerate.\nIV.7.9 Area Under Sugarcane\nArea under sugarcane was as high as 161.90 thousand ha. in 1970-71 which fell to 111.80 thousand ha. in 1984-85. During 1971-87 it continued to decline with mild year-to-year fluctuation and from 1987-88 showed upward movement reaching the level at 148.0 thousand ha. in 1990-91. During 1971-93 it showed declining trend growth rate at (-)0.77% per annum. The declining trend rate of growth was more steep during the first sub-period at (-)2.29% per annum. The second sub-period, however, showed increasing trend growth rate at 1.60% per annum. Inter-state comparison of area under sugarcane showed that Bihar ranked sixth among the major sugarcane growing states. With an area of only 142.17 thousand ha. as compared to 1881.80 thousand ha. in 1990-93 in Uttar Pradesh, one does not get solace with the sixth position of the state in area under sugarcane. The rate of increase in sugarcane area in Bihar, although positive at 1.57% during 1983-93, was also less compared to Maharashtra (3.99%), Karnataka (4.56%), and Gujarat (3.70%) during the same period.\nIV.7.10 Regional Pattern\nThe north-west plains had the largest share of area under sugarcane (85.90%) in the State total. Other zones had a negligible share in sugarcane area. Districts with high sugarcane production also had high sugarcane area. They included West Champaran (38.77%), followed by Gopalganj (16.04%) and East Champaran (10.05%).\nIV.7.11 Growth in Area\nIn terms of growth in area, the north-west alluvial plains showed a reversal from a declining trend (-2.68%) in the first sub-period to an increasing trend (1.78%) in the second sub-period. The plateau districts and the south-west alluvial plains, on the other hand, showed a continued declining trend even in the second sub-period. In the east alluvial plains, the process of change was in the opposite direction, i.e., from an increasing trend (0.97%) in the first sub-period to a declining trend (-7.21%) in the second sub-period. Among the major sugarcane growing districts, while West Champaran and Gopalganj showed relatively high area expansion (4.00% and 4.60% respectively), East Champaran showed a declining trend at (-)1.77% during the second sub-period. In districts such as Madhubani, Muzaffarpur, Saran, Munger, and Bhojpur, the area under sugarcane expanded during this period.\nIV.7.12 Yield Level of Sugarcane\nThe yield of sugarcane increased over the years in the state. It was 38.35 t/ha. in 1970-71 but declined thereafter to a level of 27.23 t/ha. in 1978-79. It maintained static condition till 1986-87 but showed a sharp increase in 1987-88 with yield level at 38.01 t/ha and further reaching a maximum of 53.72 t/ha. in 1989-90, but declined\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India experiencing varying trends in sugarcane production, with significant analysis on production stability, acceleration/deceleration in production, and area under sugarcane)##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOPALGANJ<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar noted for its high increasing growth rates in sugarcane production and high instability)##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEST CHAMPARAN<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar with high increasing growth rates in sugarcane production and significant area under sugarcane)##\n(\"entity\"<|>EAST CHAMPARAN<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar with large sugarcane production showing more stability compared to other districts)##\n(\"entity\"<|>SITAMARHI<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar experiencing acceleration in the increasing trend rate of growth in sugarcane production)##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIWAN<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar with acceleration in the increasing growth rate of sugarcane production)##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMASTIPUR<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar showing deceleration in its increasing growth rate of sugarcane production)##\n(\"entity\"<|>VAISHALI<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar with a declining growth rate in sugarcane production)##\n(\"entity\"<|>SARAN<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar showing an accelerated declining growth rate in sugarcane production)##\n(\"entity\"<|>MADHUBANI<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar with a declining trend in sugarcane area but expanded during a certain period)##\n(\"entity\"<|>DARBHANGA<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar with an accelerated declining growth rate in sugarcane production)##\n(\"entity\"<|>UTTAR PRADESH<|>GEO<|>A state in India with the largest area under sugarcane compared to Bihar)##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHARASHTRA<|>GEO<|>A state in India with a significant rate of increase in sugarcane area during the same period as Bihar)##\n(\"entity\"<|>KARNATAKA<|>GEO<|>A state in India with a higher rate of increase in sugarcane area compared to Bihar)##\n(\"entity\"<|>GUJARAT<|>GEO<|>A state in India with a notable rate of increase in sugarcane area during the same period as Bihar)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOPALGANJ<|>BIHAR<|>Gopalganj is a district in Bihar with noted sugarcane production trends<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WEST CHAMPARAN<|>BIHAR<|>West Champaran is a major sugarcane producing district in Bihar<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EAST CHAMPARAN<|>BIHAR<|>East Champaran is a district in Bihar known for its large sugarcane production<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UTTAR PRADESH<|>BIHAR<|>Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are compared for their area under sugarcane, with Uttar Pradesh having a larger area<|>5)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAHARASHTRA<|>BIHAR<|>Maharashtra's rate of increase in sugarcane area is compared to Bihar's<|>5)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KARNATAKA<|>BIHAR<|>Karnataka's rate of increase in sugarcane area is compared to Bihar's<|>5)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GUJARAT<|>BIHAR<|>Gujarat's rate of increase in sugarcane area is compared to Bihar's<|>5)<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
