He received all required scientific and technical support from KVK.\nChaudhary, who joined the navy after 10+2 level education, had to return home due to his father's illness. Following his return, he completed his bachelor and MBA courses in distance mode. Having nearly three acres of agricultural land, Chaudharyâ€™s family had been traditionally involved in the farming of paddy and maize apart from banana. Since Chaudhary's father was a teacher in a government school, his family had to depend primarily on sharecroppers for carrying out farm activities. Chaudhary took overall charge of family farm activities in 2013 following his decision to pursue agriculture as a livelihood.\nIn pursuing agricultural activities, he observed that paddy farming was not proving to be much lucrative with net income from paddy cultivation remaining restricted to little more than Rs 5000. Comparatively, maize farming was proving profitable for Chaudhary with his net income from maize cultivation being more than Rs 50000 per annum. However, he was experiencing problems in sowing maize crops since the low-lying land in which he used to cultivate maize remained waterlogged for a long period. As post-monsoon, it took a long time for waterlogged land to become dry, Chaudhary mostly could not take up sowing of maize crops in time.\nThe problem he experienced in sowing maize crops in time led him to explore other options for supplementing his income. Chaudhary, who had been in contact with Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), was suggested several measures by KVK scientists aimed at diversifying farm activities. Mushroom cultivation was among the ideas he was given by KVK scientists for supplementing income.\nChaudhary was initially a bit hesitant about starting mushroom farming. However, motivated by KVK scientists, he joined a training program on mushroom cultivation organized by NABARD in 2017. Subsequently, he also participated in a training program on mushroom cultivation organized at RAU, PUSA.\nWith scientific and technical assistance from KVK scientists, Chaudhary started micro-level mushroom farming in 2017. He began growing mushrooms in a small room of his house. The first-year produce was primarily for personal consumption. In fact, Chaudhary started commercial production of mushrooms in 2018. For large-scale production of both button and oyster varieties of mushrooms in 2018-19, he used nearly 500 separate bags for growing each of the varieties. Chaudhary was able to reap produce of 2-2.5 kg from each bag, which he sold at a price between Rs 130-180 per kilogram. Though he had no previous idea regarding what should be his strategy for selling mushrooms, he had no problem selling his produce. With purchasers from his village and outside starting to approach him, he had no problem in ensuring doorstep sell of his produce.\nTaking into consideration the advice of scientists, Chaudhary also started value addition of mushrooms. He was extended technical support by KVK in value addition. Chaudhary dried a sizeable portion of his produce for preparing mushroom powder. He sold more than 10 kg of mushroom powder at a price between Rs 1000 to Rs 1100 per kg. Chaudhary also used mushroom powder for preparing biscuits. High in demand, he was able to sell 50 kg of mushroom biscuits at Rs 350 per kg. Chaudhary was in fact unable to meet the demand for biscuits. In 2018-19, he was able to register a net income of more than Rs one lakh through the sale of mushrooms and value-added mushroom products. Despite 2020 proving to be a lean year because of the pandemic, Chaudhary could earn around Rs 50000 through peak-season sale of mushrooms. Though off-season sales of mushrooms remained comparatively low in 2020, he was able to earn Rs 15000 despite constraints. With KVK support, Chaudhary looks forward to taking up mushroom farming as well as value addition of mushrooms on a big scale in the future.

Initially struggling with low returns from traditional crops due to soil erosion and floods, Mandal started experimental papaya farming in 2007. With support from KVK and Bihar Agricultural University, he expanded his papaya cultivation, achieving significant income growth. His current annual income exceeds Rs 10 lakh from both papaya farming and nursery operations. Mandalâ€™s success has influenced many farmers in his region to adopt papaya cultivation.\n\nRanjan Sharma\nAge: 43\nVenture: Fish Farming\nVillage: Paharpura\nPanchayat: Khadasin\nBlock: Bansi\nDistrict: Arwal\nEducational Qualification: Matriculate\nInstitution Facilitating Venture: KVK, Arwal\nOverview: Ranjan Sharma, a progressive farmer from Paharpura, diversified his farming activities to include fish farming. Initially growing conventional crops, Sharma expanded into capsicum and onion farming before venturing into pisciculture in 2016. Despite early challenges, he now manages four ponds and produces various fish species, including pangasius, Rohu, and Catla. His fish farming venture has significantly boosted his income to around Rs 6.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
