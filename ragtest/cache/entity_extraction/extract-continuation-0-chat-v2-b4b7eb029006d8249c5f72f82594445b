Besides, efforts should be made to promote contract farming in maize and certain horticultural crops for which the state has huge potential. Dairy Cooperatives being a success in Bihar need further support for expansion and to enhance the health and productivity of livestock. There should be further expansion and revitalization of the fisheries and poultry sectors, which hold high potential, particularly in light of changing consumption patterns.\nEfficient Use of Modern Inputs and Balanced Use of Fertilizers\n\nEfficient and optimal use of modern inputs like quality seeds, chemical fertilizers, and other macro and micro nutrients is key to productivity improvement on a sustainable basis. Therefore, farmers should be enabled to access and use modern farm inputs in an optimal and efficient manner. Large-scale demonstration, use of nutrient and water-based soil and tissue tests should receive major emphasis. Soil testing technology is available but lacks the capacity to function. Revamping the laboratory for efficient delivery systems is essential. Efforts should be made to promote organic production technology, including the use of bio-fertilizers and bio-pesticides.\nDevelopment and Maintenance of Rural Infrastructure\n\nRural connectivity is key to raising farmers’ productivity and income. Therefore, utmost priority should be given to improving infrastructure in various aspects. The aim should be to target key constraints like poor water management, rural power supply, easy credit availability, and market access. Steps should also be taken to encourage renewable sources of energy. The state has the highest potential for small hydropower projects, wind energy, bagasse-based co-generation power from existing and proposed sugar factories, Jatropha on wastelands, and rice husk-based biomass gasification, biogas, and solar energy.\nFlood Control, Drainage, Water Management, and Mitigating Drought\n\nLack of efficient on-farm water management is considered one of the major constraints for low productivity and poor economic status of farmers in Bihar. About 41% of the total cropped area in the state is flood-prone, and there is not much scope for improvement in yield due to water logging, poor drainage, and water management. In such areas, it is essential for the state to make large-scale investments in drainage and utilization for fisheries. Flood control will also need attention for desilting of rivers and strengthening of embankments. As far as drought-prone areas are concerned, there is a need for water conservation and improving water use efficiency through rainwater harvesting, education of farmers, and the use of modern methods of irrigation. Rainwater harvesting should be a major strategy to meet irrigation needs of crops. However, the state has abundant groundwater resources which could be optimized. Shallow tube wells are the quickest means of tapping groundwater. This is now possible due to the government’s dynamic efforts on village electrification.\n\n(v) Human Capital Formation and Strengthening of Agricultural Extension Services\nTwenty-first century agriculture is knowledge and technology based and human capital development is a must. Approach to knowledge and technology adoption by the farmers are directly related to the level of their education. Dilapidated condition of human development institutions and weak institutional structure are a road block in the overall development of Bihar. Education and health should, therefore, be given the first priority for Bihar’s farm population. Besides, strengthening of agricultural research & development, appropriate to Bihar’s topology and crop profile should be an integral part of agriculture development strategy. There should be proper coordination among different agriculture extension institutions like Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Agriculture Technology Management Agency (ATMA), Rajendra Agriculture University, Kisan Call Centres, State government, financial institutions, farming community at large. Training programmes for farmers at panchayat and block levels should be organized on a regular basis for adopting modern technologies more effectively.\n(vi) Effective R & D Support\nEfficient R & D is a building block for responsive agriculture. It has been experienced that investment on agricultural education and research has been most productive. The state has one Agricultural University with 5 major campuses and has done excellently well in last few years in terms of human resource development and research output. However, the University has not got the focus it deserves. Headquarters of the University, Pusa, is a heritage for agriculture research and education. Therefore, this University should get the status of National University, which should not only meet the needs of the state but also contribute to national agriculture. The University needs support for modernization of its infrastructure as well as research facilitation for scientists. Considering the size of the State’s agriculture, consideration be given for opening one or two more agricultural universities in Bihar. Sabour Agricultural College meets all the basic pre-requisites for conversion into a university.\n(vii) Market Oriented Agriculture\nBihar produces large quantities of fruits, vegetables, and livestock products, but does not have appropriate infrastructure for value addition and marketing. The state should develop commodity specific agro-export zones and give necessary support to their marketization. As a matter of fact, with proper development of markets, cooling arrangements in storage and transportation, processing and maintenance of quality, through grading, standardization, packaging, etc., products like litchi, mango, makhana and banana and a few vegetables can be exported to other states and even beyond the country, which will help improve farmers’ income. In order to provide a level playing field for private participation in marketing, infrastructure and policy support be provided. Bihar is the first state, which has taken bold step for the reform of marketing by repealing the APMC Act, which was not conducive in modern competitive agriculture. However, there is a need for developing alternative model. The proposal of the Committee headed by Shri R.C.A. Jain be accepted to upgrade marketing of produce. A suitable model of contract farming specific to crops can be adopted to solve the problems of small and marginal farmers.\n(viii) Strategic Agricultural Diversification\nTraditional crop farming alone cannot provide adequate employment and income to a growing rural population\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DAIRY COOPERATIVES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Successful organizations in Bihar that need further support for expansion and to enhance the health and productivity of livestock)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>State in need of development in various sectors including agriculture, dairy, fisheries, poultry, and infrastructure to improve farmers' productivity and income)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOIL TESTING TECHNOLOGY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Technology available for improving agricultural productivity but lacking in capacity and efficiency)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Infrastructure development is crucial for raising farmers' productivity and income in Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KRISHI VIGYAN KENDRA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Agricultural extension institution involved in the development of agriculture in Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGRICULTURE TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (ATMA)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Institution involved in coordinating agricultural technology and management in Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAJENDRA AGRICULTURE UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>University contributing to agricultural research and education, suggested to gain National University status)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KISAN CALL CENTRES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Centers providing advice and support to farmers in Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SABOUR AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Institution meeting basic prerequisites for conversion into a university, indicating its significance in agricultural education and research)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAIRY COOPERATIVES<|>BIHAR<|>Dairy Cooperatives are recognized for their success in Bihar and are considered important for further development in the livestock sector<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOIL TESTING TECHNOLOGY<|>BIHAR<|>Soil testing technology, crucial for agricultural productivity, is available in Bihar but needs capacity enhancement<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE<|>BIHAR<|>Improving rural infrastructure is identified as a key factor for increasing productivity and income of farmers in Bihar<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KRISHI VIGYAN KENDRA<|>BIHAR<|>Krishi Vigyan Kendra plays a role in the agricultural development of Bihar through extension services<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGRICULTURE TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (ATMA)<|>BIHAR<|>ATMA is involved in the coordination of agricultural technology and management, contributing to Bihar's agricultural sector<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAJENDRA AGRICULTURE UNIVERSITY<|>BIHAR<|>Rajendra Agriculture University is a key institution for agricultural research and education in Bihar<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KISAN CALL CENTRES<|>BIHAR<|>Kisan Call Centres provide support to the farming community in Bihar, aiding in the dissemination of agricultural knowledge<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SABOUR AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE<|>BIHAR<|>Sabour Agricultural College is positioned for conversion into a university, highlighting its importance in Bihar's agricultural education and research<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
