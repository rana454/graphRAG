For example, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh, with almost equal areas, produced double the paddy output compared to Bihar. Similarly, Haryana produced almost the same level of wheat as Bihar with half the area. Non-food crops also show poor performance with relatively low area and yield. The primary issues in the foodgrains sector are low yield and shrinking area, while non-food crops suffer from low yield, low area, and largely unirrigated conditions.\n31) The lower yield of food and non-food crops can be attributed to the low uptake of modern inputs such as irrigation, fertilizers, and HYV seeds. Irrigation in the state has not been increasing due to low investment in creating irrigation potential and inefficiencies in managing existing structures. Declining water tables and inadequate maintenance of water sources have worsened the situation. High irrigation costs, mainly due to diesel pumpsets, and the inadequacy of technology for exploiting groundwater and other resources also contribute to low irrigation. The need for low-cost, appropriate irrigation technology is crucial.\n32) Fertilizer consumption, although increasing, remains relatively low in the State. This is partly due to inadequate institutional credit flow, irregular and untimely credit supply, and an inefficient supply mechanism. The unbalanced use of fertilizers, predominantly nitrogen, has adversely affected crop yield and soil fertility. This issue is more prominent in regions with high foodgrains production and irrigation.\n33) The use of HYV seeds is also inadequate in Bihar, with limited availability for certain crops and largely under irrigated conditions. There is a strong need to develop and promote HYV seeds suitable for unirrigated and dry conditions, particularly for paddy. The replacement rate of HYV seeds is also inadequate, and seed multiplication infrastructure needs improvement.\n34) Institutional credit needs significant strengthening in the State. Despite a decline in credit flow, agricultural production has increased, indicating that farmers are relying on their own resources or informal sources. The re-emergence of private borrowing reflects the inadequacy of institutional credit. The credit absorption capacity of the State is confirmed by the demand for modern inputs. The issue lies with the supply network and misconceptions about Biharâ€™s agricultural potential.\n35) Poor institutional credit flow can be attributed to the dominance of tenancy cultivation, including absentee cultivation. Tenancy cultivators lack surpluses for farm investments, and absentee landowners often have alternative income sources, reducing their motivation to invest. Security norms for bank loans are prohibitive for these farmers. Amendments to the security norms to include oral tenants are needed.\n36) Agriculture in some pockets of the State is diversifying, with increased areas for crops like rapeseed/mustard, sugarcane, jute, and others. However, the pace of diversification is slow. Districts like Purnea, East Champaran, and others have excelled in specific crops, showing potential for further diversification and involvement in high-tech agricultural projects.\n37) A disturbing trend is the shrinkage in the area available for cultivation. Both net sown area and gross cropped area are declining. This decline, coupled with increasing current fallow and barren land, reduces potential crop production. Inadequate drainage facilities, increasing alkalinity/salinity, rising water tables, and soil erosion contribute to this issue. A multi-pronged strategy is needed to address these problems, drawing from successful models like Punjabâ€™s green revolution, which combined drainage schemes, land consolidation, and modern inputs.\nC. POINTS OF ACTION\n38. On the basis of the broad findings of the study and policy implications thus arrived at, the following major points of action could be suggested:\ni) Augmentation of Land Resources\n39. There is an urgent need to check the declining trend in net sown area, caused largely by increasing current fallow, area under miscellaneous trees, and land under non-agricultural use. Increasing land dispute cases too have led to non-cultivation of land by absentee landlords. The following points of action may be necessary to check the decline in net sown area:\nCurrent fallow, particularly in the plains, is largely due to recurring flood or drought, wide inter-spell of rainfall leading to abandonment of cultivation, and water-logging due to poor drainage, especially in low-lying flood-prone areas and the tail end of canal irrigation. The question of water-logging and drainage needs to be addressed more seriously. The problem of wide inter-spell of rain could be tackled by promoting the mechanism of protective irrigation to exploit groundwater or surface water resources, particularly in the plains.\nSettlement of land dispute cases as well as providing secure tenancy with a package of incentive programs would also help in checking the net sown area from declining.\nInvestment programs/schemes for converting land under miscellaneous trees into cultivable areas may be launched to the extent it is environmentally friendly.\n40. Canal irrigation, particularly in the east plains, has brought with it several issues, partly by increasing the water table leading to alkalinity/salinity of soils and partly by sand deposits. Disposal of canal water at the tail end has also rendered vast land uncultivable. The following measures may be initiated in all such areas by launching area-specific schemes:\nImplementation of area-specific schemes to facilitate land treatment at the farm level.\nFacilitating a change of cropping pattern best suited to new conditions.\nSeparate schemes of investment may be launched to cover farmers whose land is affected by canal water due to sand deposits or erosion.\nLand at the tail end of the canal needs separate planning attention.\n41. The increasing menace of soil erosion is the root cause of land turning barren in the plateau, caused largely by deforestation as well as abandonment of mines. The scale of investment required for treating abandoned mines or for afforestation programs may warrant the involvement of the corporate sector. This needs to be examined separately.\n42.
