Creation of additional irrigation potential, coupled with adequate prices, may encourage the cultivation of more cash crops in the state.\nConsidering the increase in the percentage area under non-food grain crops as a proxy for crop diversification towards commercialization, and relating it to the percentage of gross irrigated area, there is a significant negative relationship between the two with elasticity at -0.44 at the state level. Similar relationships are observed in most districts, with very few districts showing a positive relationship, mostly with low elasticities. At first glance, one might conclude that irrigation influences crop diversification negatively, contrary to expectations. It should be noted that cash crop cultivation is region-specific. For instance, jute is grown in Purnea, Katihar, and Saharsa in the east plains; tobacco and chillies in Vaishali, Muzaffarpur, Samastipur, and Begusarai in the north-west; sugarcane in Gopalganj, West Champaran, and East Champaran in the north-west; and fruits and vegetables in Vaishali, Muzaffarpur in the north-west, and Purnea and Katihar in the east plains. Instability in the production of cash crops, suggested by high fluctuations in their area, is due to several factors including inadequate prices. The case of sugarcane is particularly noteworthy. More than 80.0% of sugarcane is sold to sugar mills at the lowest prices in the country. With high cultivation costs, mainly due to irrigation through diesel pump sets and relatively low prices for the product, the economics of sugarcane cultivation becomes unfavorable in the state. Additionally, payment delays by sugar mills, sometimes extending up to three years, provide further disincentives. Transportation issues and long waiting times further dampen farmers' enthusiasm. The situations with tobacco, jute, chillies, fruits, and vegetables also require detailed study.\nIX.23 Summary of Irrigation Trends\nDespite vast potential, the availability of irrigation was low in Bihar at 42.85% of the net sown area in 1990-91, compared to 93.52% in Punjab, 76.05% in Haryana, and 60.92% in Uttar Pradesh. The potential created was only 43.07% for major/medium irrigation and 25.46% for groundwater.\nThe increase in net irrigated area from 28.78 lakh ha. in 1976-77 to 33.05 lakh ha. in 1990-91 was not substantial, showing an increase of only 11.50% over 15 years.\nThe dominant source of irrigation was tubewells (42.0%), followed by canals (33.0%). Tubewell irrigation alone showed expansion, while all other sources, including canal irrigation, recorded a decline.\nAcross different agro-climatic zones, the south-west plains (81.14%) were relatively more irrigated, comparable with more prosperous states. The north-west and east plains lagged far behind with net irrigated areas around 45.05%. The plateau zone had a negligible 7.19% irrigated area. The south-west plains showed growth in irrigated area, while all other zones displayed a declining trend.\nAnalysis of growth by different sources of irrigation indicated that canal irrigation was increasing only in the east and south-west plains. Prominent districts showing increased canal irrigation included Aurangabad, Saharsa, Munger, and Bhagalpur. Conversely, districts like East Champaran, West Champaran, and Gopalganj showed a decline in canal irrigation. The aggregate decline in canal irrigation was 1.04 lakh hectares over 1977-91, forming 9.53% of canal irrigation in 1990-91.\nTubewell irrigation, prominent in the north-west plains, showed an increasing trend in all zones except the plateau. Districts with notable increases in tubewell irrigation included Dharbhanga, Madhubani, Vaishali, West Champaran, Begusarai, Purnea, and Nawadah. The aggregate decline in tubewell irrigation worked out to 0.49 lakh ha., which formed 3.53% of tubewell irrigation in 1990-91.\nIrrigation through other wells was prominent in the plateau region and showed a declining trend. The aggregate decline was 1.62 lakh ha., forming 124.5% of its irrigated area in 1990-91. Irrigation through ponds/tanks also declined, with an aggregate decline of 0.38 lakh ha. in 1990-91.\nIrrigation intensity was low at 124.0% in Bihar compared to 180.0% in Punjab, 163.0% in Haryana, and 131.0% at the all-India level. Across different zones, it did not vary widely. However, the south-west plains had relatively high irrigation intensity at 134.0%. Among districts, it was relatively high in Gopalganj (190%), Katihar (178%), and Rohtas (157%).\nIrrigation was primarily used for foodgrain crops, with their share at 93.07% of total irrigation. Among these, cereals (92.89%) occupied a significant share in irrigation, with crops such as paddy, wheat, and maize having the largest share.\nAnalysis of irrigated area for major crops suggests that wheat had the highest irrigation coverage at 85.52% in 1990-91. For paddy and maize, coverage was lower at 35.43% and 43.15% respectively. Among non-food grains, tobacco had higher irrigation coverage at 60.76% in 1990\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
