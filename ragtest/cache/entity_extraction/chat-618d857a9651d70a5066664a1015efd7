A huge quantity of water was reserved for supplemental and drinking (animal) purposes. The water table has risen by 44%, followed by area expansion under off-season vegetable cultivation in 10.0 ha, summer paddy cultivation in 10.0 ha, wheat cultivation in 50.0 ha, and safe harvesting of standing paddy from 30.0 ha during acute scarcity of rainwater. Monocropping has turned into double and in some cases multiple cropping in the village.\nReplication of Intervention of Temporary Low-Cost Water Harvesting Structure: Huge available water not utilized properly. Inclined to cultivate double or multiple crops in more than 30 ha. Ensuring the paddy seed production in 10 acres of land which helped in sustaining the seed bank.\n\nProduction Module\nDemonstrations include introducing drought and flood-tolerant paddy varieties, advancement of planting dates of crops, community nurseries for delayed monsoon, location-specific intercropping systems, brown manuring, promotion of pulses utilizing post-monsoon rainfall, integrated crop/pest/disease management, and growing vegetables as contingency crops.\nTechnology Demonstration and Impact\nTechnology Demonstrated\nDrought Tolerant Varieties\nThe drought tolerant varieties demonstrated include Sahbhagi, Anjali, A 404, Naveen, and Abhishek. The area covered was 185, with 899 farmers benefiting. The percentage increase ranged from 16.8 to 150.5.\nFlood Tolerant Varieties\nThe flood tolerant varieties demonstrated were Swarna Sub 1 and Sabita. The area covered was 64, and 23.5 farmers were covered. The percentage increase ranged from 22 to 33.5.\nAdvancement of Planting Dates\nAdvancements in planting dates for crops such as wheat, lentil, and mustard were implemented over an area of 53.4. A total of 246 farmers were covered, with a percentage increase ranging from 31 to 231.5.\nStaggered Community Nurseries\nStaggered community nurseries for crops including paddy, brinjal, cauliflower, and tomato covered an area of 19.3. The number of farmers covered was 85, with a percentage increase ranging from 11.3 to 24.3.\nLocation-Specific Intercropping\nLocation-specific intercropping was applied over an area of 48.3, benefiting 321 farmers. The percentage increase ranged from 55.5 to 134.6.\nCrop Diversification\nCrop diversification efforts covered an area of 88.4, with 534 farmers involved. The percentage increase ranged from 26.0 to 68.8.\nBrown Manuring\nBrown manuring was practiced over an area of 25.0, involving 95 farmers. The percentage increase ranged from 12.2 to 16.0.\nNote: One of the important interventions has been the promotion of community nursery for paddy as an approach to contingent availability of seedlings during drought or flood in the NICRA adopted village(s). Seedlings were raised by sowing seeds at 15-day intervals in three stages, and farmers were allowed to take as many seedlings as they could transplant depending on rainfall conditions.\nLivestock and Fisheries Demonstration Programme\nThe livestock and fisheries demonstration programme includes breed up-gradation, balanced feed and fodder management through mineral mixture, feed blocks, and silage making, azolla feeding, and breed animal health management through deworming and vaccination. It also focuses on improved shelters for animals, fish pond cleaning, fish farming, pig farming, and clean milk and fodder production. Improved cross-ventilated poultry, dairy, and goatary sheds were introduced, with improved poultry sheds featuring well-ventilated systems to reduce mortality rates. Sheds in shady areas reduced heat stress and increased milk yield.\nInstitutional Intervention\nInstitutional interventions included the establishment of seed banks, fodder banks, commodity groups, and custom hiring for timely operations. Community nursery raising, irrigation, collective marketing, and climate literacy through a village-level weather station were also implemented. Awareness camps were organized, and Jay Prakash VCRMC, constituted at KVK Nawada, Bihar, generated a maximum amount of Rs. 96,972 in the VCRMC bank account and received the National Award for the best performing VCRMC in 2012-13.\nICT in Agriculture\nThe use of information and communication tools in agriculture, although a relatively new venture, has been applied extensively by KVKs in Bihar and Jharkhand. Tools such as Kisan Mobile Advisory Services, Kisan Chaupal, and Farmers’ Portal are used by all KVKs in these states. Registered mobile numbers of more than 10,000 farmers are maintained to provide advisory services in events of delayed rainfall, scanty rainfall, drought, and flood. Contingent crop planning in adverse climatic situations is made available to farmers through ICT tools along with other communication measures.\nValue Addition\nAbundant production of vegetables, mushrooms, fruits, etc., in both states is effectively utilized for value addition to provide additional income and employment to farm women, as well as to prevent spoilage and avoid market glut. Self-help groups are primarily trained for value addition and marketing of their produce under the brand name of KVK/host organization. Large-scale value addition in districts such as Gumla, Godda, Dumka, Palamu, Ranchi, Hazaribag, Giridih, Muzaffarpur, Patna, Rohtas,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
