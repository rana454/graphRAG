The project context includes an environment of extensive feudalism and social fragmentation. The project employed a strategy of facilitating BDS markets to promote technical services, linkages, and promoting choice in marketing while strictly minimizing direct grants. The six-year project (2002-8) supported by the Ford Foundation built upon a three-year credit facilitation activity undertaken by EDA with a limited fee-for-service provision made by the Small Industries Development Bank of India.\nThe EDA project has resulted in substantial productivity gains for producers of honey and a significant increase in the price realized by them, leading to a phenomenal increase in the number of producers. This was achieved through the introduction of technical services to enhance productivity, facilitation of market competition amongst buyers, the promotion of producers’ associations for collective selling, and policy advocacy with the complementary development of linkages. The variable strength of the emerging producers’ associations is symptomatic of the fragmented and feudal social structure of the region. It would take a substantial additional effort by EDA to address this issue and cement the collective action enabled by these institutions. Their potential has, nevertheless, been demonstrated. The patchy approach of the banks to providing credit support also needs to be addressed.\n\nHighlights\nStrengths:\nProfessional facilitation team\nStrict market-based strategy: no grants to value chain actors\nExcellent linkage support & effective, focused advocacy\nIncreased competition amongst buyers\nIssues:\nSocial fragmentation limits the efficacy of producer associations\nBanks patchy in providing credit support\nDairy federation support still equivocal\nLack of baseline information – sector and producer levels\n\nMain Performance Indicators\nSample – indicative estimates\nExchange rate: US$ = Rs 48\n[Deflated figure based on CPI for Agricultural Labor]\nThis report is derived from the draft report on testing guidelines for assessing the impact of value chain approaches on rural poverty; under collaborative development led by CATIE (Costa Rica), supported by the Ford Foundation.\n\nRating Rationale\nDimension Details:\nStatus of VC Project:\nVC Location – Project Area: Muzaffarpur + 2 adjoining districts of Bihar, India\nYears of Operation: 3 (credit only) + 6\nLegal Status of VC Facilitator: Private limited company\nFinanced by: Ford Foundation\nSupport from Government: Negligible\nCurrent Status of Programme: Self-managed\nEconomic Context:\nArea Population (3 districts): 10 million\nIncome per Capita, Bihar: Rs 10,570 ($264)\nIncome per Capita, India: Rs 33,283 ($832)\nRural Households Below National Poverty Line (2006): 28% (India 18%)\nAgricultural Land Distribution: 78% holdings <1 hectare\nAgriculture/State GDP: 40%\nRural Adult Literacy – Male: 58% (India 71%)\nRural Adult Literacy – Female: 30% (India 47%)\nKey VC Initiatives:\nFacilitate Bank Linkage: Loan application and repayments\nMarket Support: Start independent marketing agents, contacts with corporate agents, alliance with dairy federation to market honey\nProductivity & Quality Improvements: Training (government linkage) – basic beekeeping, extraction of byproducts\nFormation & Capacity Building of Community Institutions: Formation of associations/state level federation, collective marketing, training in business skills\nPromotion of Other Linkages: Establish honey processing plants, testing facility; production of beehive boxes, foundation sheets, small equipment\nAdvocacy: Lobbying to reduce tax, publication of directory, workshops for banks to increase the flow of credit to beekeepers and VC links\nTarget Population: Marginal and small farmer households; backward castes (beekeeping)\nContribution to Poverty Reduction: More households engaged in honey production, higher earnings, more hired wage employment (male), more employment in linked activities, reduced outmigration.\nProject Context: Bihar is the second poorest state in India, with the lowest per capita income ($264) where 28% of rural households live below the national poverty line (18% all India, rural).\nProject Management: The VC project has been managed by a team of 3-5 professionals under the aegis of a for-profit social enterprise. EDA continues to facilitate the VC (albeit at a reduced level) even after the project closed in June 2008.\nStrategy: Range of activities at all levels of the VC. Strategy of minimizing grant support to producers and BDS providers. Benefits continue post-project.\nProject Outputs: Significant increase in productivity from 30kg to over 40kg per hive, even in a year of moderate productivity, and a substantial increase in the number of producers from around 1,800 to over 9,000.\nLinkages: Both upstream and downstream linkages have been significantly enhanced. These include increased numbers of bee box suppliers, foundation\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
