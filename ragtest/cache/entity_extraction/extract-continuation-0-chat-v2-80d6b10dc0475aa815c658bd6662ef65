Given his family’s agricultural background, he was inclined towards farming but wanted to pursue something unique rather than conventional crops. In 2011, Kumar sought advice from scientists at BAU and was encouraged to start mushroom farming. He participated in a training program organized by BAU, which provided him with technical skills and support for starting mushroom cultivation.\nKumar began with oyster mushrooms due to the ease of cultivation and the availability of agricultural waste for production. He started small with 300 sq meters and gradually expanded to 3000 sq meters, adding varieties like white milky mushrooms and button mushrooms. His initial success led him to address challenges related to market linkage by supplying his produce to hotels and establishing local connections.\nHe also set up a small spawn lab to overcome the challenges of spawn supply and now sells 15-16 kilograms of spawn daily, with an annual income between Rs 2.0 lakh and Rs 2.5 lakh from both mushrooms and spawn. Kumar’s success has inspired many in his village to take up mushroom farming, and he has also facilitated a common selling counter for local growers.\nAchievements:\nMushroom Varieties: Oyster, white milky, and button mushrooms.\nProduction Area: Expanded from 300 sq meters to 3000 sq meters.\nNet Monthly Income: Around Rs 25,000 during the season.\nAnnual Income: Rs 2.0 lakh to Rs 2.5 lakh from mushrooms and spawn.\nAdditional Contributions: Established a spawn lab, provided training, and motivated others in mushroom farming.\n\nDilip Kumar Singh\nAge: 51 Years\nVenture: Vegetable farming\nVillage: Mehaddiganj\nPanchayat: Mohaddiganj\nBlock: Sasaram\nDistrict: Rohtas\nEducational Qualification: Intermediate\nInstitution Facilitating Venture: Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), Rohtas\nProfile:\nDilip Kumar Singh, initially a marginal farmer, transitioned to large-scale vegetable farming with significant support from KVK, Rohtas. After starting vegetable farming in 1993 on a two-acre leased land, Singh faced challenges, particularly with disease management. In 2008, KVK scientists helped him save his cauliflower crop from disease, which marked the beginning of his association with KVK.\nSingh participated in various training programs, including one organized by the Indian Institute of Vegetable Research (IIVR) and Banaras Hindu University (BHU), which introduced him to advanced techniques. Motivated by the training, he expanded his farming area to 20 acres and embraced both organic and inorganic methods.\nAchievements:\nGross Annual Income: Increased from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 17 lakh by 2019.\nInnovations: Implemented mixed\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>KRISHI VIGYAN KENDRA (KVK), JEHANABAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Institution facilitating beekeeping venture for Suman Kumar in Jehanabad)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NALANDA COLLEGE OF HORTICULTURE (NCOH), NOORSARAI, NALANDA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Institution facilitating plant grafting venture for Neelam Kumari)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY (BAU), SABOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Institution facilitating mushroom and spawn production venture for Manoj Kumar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KRISHI VIGYAN KENDRA (KVK), ROHTAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Institution facilitating vegetable farming venture for Dilip Kumar Singh)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUMAN KUMAR<|>PERSON<|>Sharecropper turned beekeeper in Jairam Bigha, Jehanabad, facilitated by KVK, Jehanabad)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEELAM KUMARI<|>PERSON<|>Homemaker turned plant grafter in Bhangbal Bigha, facilitated by NCOH, Noorsarai, Nalanda)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MANOJ KUMAR<|>PERSON<|>Retired army personnel turned mushroom farmer in Punsia, facilitated by BAU, Sabour)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DILIP KUMAR SINGH<|>PERSON<|>Marginal farmer turned large-scale vegetable farmer in Mehaddiganj, facilitated by KVK, Rohtas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JEHANABAD<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar where Suman Kumar's beekeeping venture is located)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHARSHARIF<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar where Neelam Kumari's plant grafting venture is located)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BANKA<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar where Manoj Kumar's mushroom farming venture is located)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROHTAS<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar where Dilip Kumar Singh's vegetable farming venture is located)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUMAN KUMAR<|>KRISHI VIGYAN KENDRA (KVK), JEHANABAD<|>Suman Kumar's beekeeping venture was facilitated by KVK, Jehanabad<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEELAM KUMARI<|>NALANDA COLLEGE OF HORTICULTURE (NCOH), NOORSARAI, NALANDA<|>Neelam Kumari's plant grafting venture was facilitated by NCOH, Noorsarai, Nalanda<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MANOJ KUMAR<|>BIHAR AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY (BAU), SABOUR<|>Manoj Kumar's mushroom farming venture was facilitated by BAU, Sabour<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DILIP KUMAR SINGH<|>KRISHI VIGYAN KENDRA (KVK), ROHTAS<|>Dilip Kumar Singh's vegetable farming venture was facilitated by KVK, Rohtas<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
