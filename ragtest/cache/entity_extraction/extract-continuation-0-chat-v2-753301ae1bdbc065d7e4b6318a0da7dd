Its fertile land, huge water resources, and conducive climatic conditions imply tremendous potential for the agricultural sector. Despite this, productivity of crops in Bihar compares poorly with other states. Thus, at the core of the new agricultural policy for Bihar is the focus on increasing productivity of crops, not merely in comparison with the national average but in comparison with the best productivity standards achieved in any State in India. Following major initiatives have been taken by the State government in the last one year:\nFood security, Increase in farmer’s income, Increase in crop productivity, and Environmental conservation have been fixed as the four targets of the new agricultural policy regime.\nATMAs have been constituted in 23 districts of the State which did not have its ATMA coverage under the centrally sponsored programme. Thus all the districts of the State now have ATMA coverage.\nA megaproject for the establishment of soil testing laboratories in all 534 blocks of the State has been sanctioned, to take soil testing facilities right to the door of the farmers.\n31 new seed testing laboratories are to be established in the State to give each district its own seed testing laboratory.\nThe Chief Minister Horticulture Mission has been started in 19 districts of the State which were not covered under National Horticulture Mission, thereby universalizing the programme in the State.\nMicro-nutrient testing laboratories have been established in 3 districts of the State.\nResearch and Educational infrastructure of Rajendra Agricultural University, which happens to be the only agricultural university of the State, has been strengthened.\nAgricultural Produce Marketing Board has been abolished.\nBihar State Seed Corporation has been revived, and seed production has been started on 45 state agricultural farms which were lying inoperative.\nFarmers’ Commission has been established.\nLand Reform Commission has been established.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NEW AGRICULTURAL POLICY<|>EVENT<|>A policy made by the State government in 2006 focusing on increasing the productivity of crops in Bihar to match or exceed the best productivity standards in India)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STATE GOVERNMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The governing body of Bihar that initiated the New Agricultural Policy in 2006 to improve agricultural productivity and introduced various agricultural initiatives)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India with natural advantages in agriculture, aiming to increase its crop productivity through the New Agricultural Policy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATMAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Agricultural Technology Management Agencies constituted in 23 districts of Bihar to extend ATMA coverage under a centrally sponsored programme)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAJENDRA AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The only agricultural university in Bihar, whose research and educational infrastructure has been strengthened as part of the agricultural initiatives)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR STATE SEED CORPORATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An organization revived by the State government for seed production on 45 state agricultural farms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FARMERS’ COMMISSION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A commission established by the State government to address the rights and concerns of small and marginal farmers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAND REFORM COMMISSION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A commission established to undertake land reforms in Bihar)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW AGRICULTURAL POLICY<|>STATE GOVERNMENT<|>The New Agricultural Policy was made by the State government to improve agricultural productivity in Bihar<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATMAS<|>STATE GOVERNMENT<|>ATMAs were constituted in 23 districts of Bihar as part of the agricultural initiatives by the State government<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAJENDRA AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY<|>STATE GOVERNMENT<|>The State government has strengthened the research and educational infrastructure of Rajendra Agricultural University<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR STATE SEED CORPORATION<|>STATE GOVERNMENT<|>The Bihar State Seed Corporation was revived by the State government for seed production<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FARMERS’ COMMISSION<|>STATE GOVERNMENT<|>The Farmers’ Commission was established by the State government to support small and marginal farmers<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAND REFORM COMMISSION<|>STATE GOVERNMENT<|>The Land Reform Commission was established by the State government as part of its policy initiatives<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW AGRICULTURAL POLICY<|>BIHAR<|>The New Agricultural Policy aims to increase the productivity of crops in Bihar<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
