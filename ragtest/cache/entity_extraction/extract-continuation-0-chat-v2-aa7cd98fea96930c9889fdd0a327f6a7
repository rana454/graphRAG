In TE 2013-14, potato yield in Bihar was 20.2 MT per hectare, compared to the all-India average of 21.9 MT per hectare. The state’s productivity in vegetables like okra, brinjal, onion, and tomato is higher than the national average, although it lags in crops like cauliflower and cabbage. However, Bihar is gradually closing the gap in these areas, highlighting the potential of vegetable cultivation in the state.\n\nBihar devotes about 4% of its GCA to fruit cultivation, slightly above the national average of 3.4%. The primary fruits grown in the state are mango, banana, litchi, and guava. In TE 2013-14, mango orchards occupied 49% of the area under fruit cultivation, followed by banana (11%), litchi (10.4%), and guava (9.9%). The state’s fruit productivity is around 13.5 MT per hectare, higher than the national average of 11.8 MT per hectare. Bihar is the leading litchi-producing state, contributing about 42.7% of the country’s total production, and ranks fifth in mango production, contributing approximately 8% of the total. Mango and litchi account for about 59.4% of the fruit cultivation area in Bihar.\n\nParadox of Stagnant Productivity and Increased Input Use in Crop Production\n\nAlthough rice and wheat dominate Bihar’s agriculture, their productivity growth has been slow, and yields remain below the national average. This is also the case for sugarcane and potatoes. Despite this, Bihar’s farmers have increasingly adopted yield-enhancing inputs such as quality seeds, irrigation, and fertilizers.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Bihar’s seed replacement rates (SRR) for crops like paddy and wheat were low, at 6.3% and 8.4%, respectively. However, the Bihar government’s initiatives, including the Agriculture Road Map (ARM)-I and various seed promotion programs, have significantly improved SRR. By 2011-12, SRR had risen to 38% for paddy, 34.8% for wheat, and 100% for maize, surpassing the national average for maize.\n\nAlongside better seed usage, irrigation coverage in Bihar increased from 57% of GCA in 2001-02 to 68.5% in 2012-13, compared to the national average of 47.6%. Fertilizer consumption also rose from 87.5 kg/hectare in 2003-04 to 199.7 kg/hectare in 2012-13, significantly higher than the national average of 130.8 kg/hectare. Despite this, concerns remain about the diversion of subsidized fertilizers to neighboring countries, which could distort fertilizer usage patterns.\n\nFarm mechanization has been another focus area for Bihar’s agricultural strategy. The state has seen a substantial increase in the adoption of zero-tillage machines and combine harvesters, although the use of power tillers has declined slightly. Despite these efforts, the lack of updated land records and collateral issues have limited farmers' access to agricultural credit, which could further enhance productivity.\n\nLivestock Sector\n\nAnimal husbandry and dairy are crucial income-generating activities for Bihar’s rural population, alongside crop cultivation. The livestock sector’s share in GVOA increased from 25.4% in TE 2002-03 to 31% in TE 2013-14, surpassing the national average of 26%. The composition of the livestock sector has shifted, with the share of meat decreasing and the share of milk increasing.\n\nMilk Segment\n\nThe milk sector has been the main driver of growth in Bihar’s livestock sector. The share of milk in GVOA increased from 14% in TE 2003-04 to 23% in TE 2013-14, while the national share remained at 17%. About 55% of the milk produced in Bihar is cow milk, and 42% is buffalo milk.\n\nBihar's milk production grew from 2.7 million tonnes in 2001-02 to 7.2 million tonnes in 2013-14, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.9%, compared to the national average of 3.8%. However, Bihar's milk productivity remains lower than states like Punjab, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh, primarily due to a lower proportion of genetically superior cattle (crossbred). While crossbred cattle make up 32.9% of Bihar’s female cattle population, this is still significantly lower than in states like Punjab, where the proportion is 91.5%.\n\nThe Bihar State Milk Co-operative Federation (COMFED), established in 1983, has played a pivotal role in developing the state’s dairy sector. COMFED's cooperative model, similar to the Anand pattern in Gujarat, has seen robust growth in milk procurement, but only about 10% of the milk produced in Bihar is currently processed by COMFED, indicating a substantial untapped market for milk processing in the state.\n\n                                                           \nMeat Segment\n\nThe meat sector in Bihar constitutes about 5% of the Gross Value of Output from Agriculture (GVOA), with a slight decline from 6% in the early 2000s. Meat production in the state increased by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.7% between 2001-02 and 2013-14, which is significantly lower than the national average of 9.5%. Consequently, Bihar's share in India's total meat production dropped from 8.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>Bihar is a state in India known for its agricultural productivity, particularly in vegetables and fruits, and has a significant livestock sector)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UTTAR PRADESH<|>GEO<|>State in India, leading potato producer ahead of Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEST BENGAL<|>GEO<|>State in India, second-leading potato producer ahead of Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGRICULTURE ROAD MAP (ARM)-I<|>EVENT<|>A government initiative in Bihar aimed at improving agricultural productivity through various programs, including seed promotion)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR STATE MILK CO-OPERATIVE FEDERATION (COMFED)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A cooperative federation established in 1983 to develop the dairy sector in Bihar, following a model similar to Gujarat's Anand pattern)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>UTTAR PRADESH<|>Bihar is the third-largest potato producer in India after Uttar Pradesh<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>WEST BENGAL<|>Bihar follows West Bengal in potato production, ranking third in India<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>AGRICULTURE ROAD MAP (ARM)-I<|>The Agriculture Road Map (ARM)-I is a significant initiative by the Bihar government to enhance agricultural productivity in the state<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>BIHAR STATE MILK CO-OPERATIVE FEDERATION (COMFED)<|>COMFED has played a pivotal role in the development of the dairy sector in Bihar<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
