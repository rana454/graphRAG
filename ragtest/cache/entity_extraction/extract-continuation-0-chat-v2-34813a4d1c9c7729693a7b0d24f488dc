The rate of decline was high in Bihar (-4.27%) during the same period.\nIV.10.9 Regional Pattern\nZones/districts with high chilli production had also high area under it. For example, the east plains with maximum production of chilli (41.11%) had maximum area under chilli as well (48.39%). It was followed by the north-west plains (22.11%) and the south-west plains (20.10%). It was relatively much less in the plateau zone (9.40%). Across different districts, the area under chilli was maximum (40.49%) in Begusarai, followed by Samastipur (9.77%) and Rohtas (7.25%). Other districts with relatively high area under chilli included:\nEast Champaran (2.74%)\nMuzaffarpur (2.51%)\nVaishali (3.45%) in the north-west plains\nPurnea (4.16%) in the east plains\nGaya (4.23%) and Patna (5.24%) in the south-west plains\nPalamu (5.53%) and Ranchi (1.86%) in the plateau zone\nIt is also observed that Rohtas with a share in chilli production at 21.84% had only 7.25% share in the State's chilli area. This was largely due to high yield level in this district.\nIV.10.10 Shrinkage in Area under Chilli\nShrinkage in area under chilli was observed in all the agro-climatic zones during 1977-91. However, it was relatively high (-11.82%) in the north-west alluvial plains, followed by the east alluvial plains (-6.18%). The rate of decline was slightly less in respect of the south-west alluvial plains and plateau districts at (-2.84%) and (-4.37%) respectively during this period. Shrinkage in area was more prominent during the second sub-period in respect of the north-west alluvial plains (-18.91%) and east alluvial plains (-14.42%). In the case of the east alluvial plains, it was a case of reversal from increasing trend in the first sub-period (0.74%) to declining trend (-14.42%) in the second sub-period. The south-west alluvial plains and plateau districts showed declining trend in both the sub-periods. Across different districts, the area under chilli was recorded to expand in districts being less dominant in chilli cultivation. They included:\nWest Champaran (8.07%)\nSaran (1.76%)\nNawadah (2.43%)\nRohtas (3.70%)\nHazaribagh (9.12%)\nRanchi (1.00%)\nDistricts dominant in chilli cultivation such as Begusarai, Samastipur, Rohtas, Patna, and Purnea showed declining trend in its area in the range of (-0.70%) and (-27.34%).\niii) Yield of Chilli\nIV.10.11 Yield Trend\nUnlike production and area, the yield of chilli showed an increasing trend in the state, albeit marginally. It was 0.79 tonnes/ha. in 1970-71, which showed upward movement reaching its peak at 1.24 tonnes/ha. in 1981-82. The yield, however, started declining from 1984-85, touching the minimum of 0.80 tonnes/ha. in 1988-89. The trend rate of growth in the yield of chilli was found to be increasing (0.54%) during 1971-93. However, it showed a declining trend at (-)2.50% per annum in the second sub-period as against an increasing trend of 3.29% per annum in the first sub-period. Comparing the yield level with other major chilli-growing states, it was found to be relatively high at 1.02 tonnes/ha. in 1990-93 for Bihar. It was only next to Andhra Pradesh (1.43 tonnes/ha.). In other states, it was much less at 0.29 tonnes/ha. in Karnataka, 0.50 tonnes/ha. in Maharashtra, and 0.81 tonnes/ha. in Orissa. In terms of growth rate, however, while it showed an increase in yield at 2.50% per annum at all-India level, 3.53% for Andhra Pradesh, and 0.50% for Orissa, it was declining at (-)1.52% in Bihar during 1983-93.\nIV.10.12 Regional Pattern\nAcross different zones, the east plains excelled in chilli production as well as in area. However, in terms of yield, it was impressively high at 1.4 t/ha. in the south-west plains as against a low of 0.69 t/ha. in the east plains, 0.69 t/ha. in the north-west plains, and 0.50 t/ha. in the plateau zone. Across different districts, Rohtas emerged at the top with almost twice the yield level (0.25 t/ha.). Other districts to show relatively high yield included:\nBhojpur (0.15 t/ha.)\nPatna (0.12 t/ha.) in the south-west plains\nKatihar (0.14 t/ha.) and Purnea (0.12 t/ha.) in the east plains\nIn Beg\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>KARNATAKA<|>GEO<|>A state in India that showed a declining trend in chilli production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHARASHTRA<|>GEO<|>A state in India that also showed a declining trend in chilli production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India where the rate of decline in chilli production was significantly high)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEGUSARAI<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with the maximum area under chilli cultivation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMASTIPUR<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with a significant area under chilli cultivation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROHTAS<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar known for high yield level in chilli production despite having a smaller share in the state's chilli area)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EAST CHAMPARAN<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with area under chilli cultivation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUZAFFARPUR<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with area under chilli cultivation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VAISHALI<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with area under chilli cultivation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PURNIA<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with area under chilli cultivation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAYA<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with area under chilli cultivation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PATNA<|>GEO<|>Capital city of Bihar with area under chilli cultivation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PALAMU<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with area under chilli cultivation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RANCHI<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with area under chilli cultivation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANDHRA PRADESH<|>GEO<|>State in India with the highest yield of chilli production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORISSA<|>GEO<|>State in India with chilli production)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROHTAS<|>BIHAR<|>Rohtas is a district in Bihar known for its chilli production<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BEGUSARAI<|>BIHAR<|>Begusarai is a district in Bihar with the maximum area under chilli cultivation<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAMASTIPUR<|>BIHAR<|>Samastipur is a district in Bihar with significant chilli cultivation<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANDHRA PRADESH<|>BIHAR<|>Andhra Pradesh has a higher yield of chilli production compared to Bihar<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KARNATAKA<|>MAHARASHTRA<|>Both states showed a declining trend in chilli production, similar to Bihar<|>2)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
