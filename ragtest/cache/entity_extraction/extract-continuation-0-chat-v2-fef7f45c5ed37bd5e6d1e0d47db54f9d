Potato formed 21.17% of the non-food crop area in the state. The growth in potato production and its regional pattern in Bihar are discussed below.\nIV.9.1 Production\nThe production of potato in Bihar initially showed a declining trend but recovered to reach 1,383.0 thousand tonnes in 1975-76. It remained stagnant at around 1,250-1,350 thousand tonnes until 1985-86. Production surged to over 1,523.0 thousand tonnes in 1986-87 and stabilized at around 1,557.6 thousand tonnes. The annual growth rate of potato production during 1971-93 was 2.28%. In the two sub-periods, the growth rate was 2.03% in the first sub-period and 2.28% in the second sub-period. Compared to the national level or major potato-growing states, Bihar’s growth rate was less impressive. For instance, the national rate was 2.65% during 1983-93, while West Bengal had a growth rate of 8.51%, and Uttar Pradesh had a rate of 3.75%.\nIV.9.2 Regional Pattern\nThe north-west plains emerged as the major potato-growing zone, contributing 37.64% of the state’s production. Other zones had production shares ranging between 22.90% and 17.68%. Key potato-producing districts included:\nNorth-West Plains: Samastipur (5.98%), East Champaran (4.73%), Madhubani (4.26%), and Saran (4.16%)\nEast Plains: Begusarai (4.30%) and Saharsa (4.18%)\nSouth-West Plains: Gaya (4.83%), Nalanda (5.70%), and Rohtas (4.42%)\nPlateau Zone: Hazaribagh (5.44%) and Ranchi (4.21%)\nIV.9.3 Growth Trends by Zone\nSouth-West Alluvial Plains: Declining trend at (-0.35%)\nNorth-West Alluvial Plains: Increasing trend at 1.36%\nEast Alluvial Plains: Increasing trend at 4.64%\nPlateau Districts: Increasing trend at 3.96%\nIn the north-west alluvial plains, the growth rate improved from (-0.79%) in the first sub-period to 3.02% in the second sub-period. Conversely, the east alluvial plains experienced a slowdown from 5.29% to 4.50%. The south-west alluvial plains saw a reduction in the rate of decline from (-6.91%) to (-0.79%), and plateau districts showed a marginal improvement from 2.56% to 3.10%.\nIV.9.4 Regional Growth Rates\nGrowth rates were higher in districts with significant potato production:\nEast Champaran: 5.29%\nMadhubani: 9.60%\nSamastipur: 5.15%\nBegusarai: 11.40%\nPurnea: 9.67%\nSaharsa: 4.88%\nRohtas: 5.71%\nHazaribagh: 5.48%\nRanchi: 3.19%\nIV.9.5 Instability in Potato Production\nThe state-level growth rate was fairly stable with a coefficient of variation of 7.41%. The north-west plains had a coefficient of variation of 7.67%. The plateau and east zones were less stable with coefficients of variation of 15.81% and 13.72%, respectively. The south-west plains had a high coefficient of variation at 16.10%. At the district level, except for Purnea and Samastipur, districts with an increasing trend had high instability, with coefficients of variation exceeding 25%. Purnea and Samastipur had relatively more stable growth with coefficients of variation of 16.32% and 14.58%, respectively. Declining trend districts showed more stability with coefficients of variation less than 20%, including Saran, Sitamarhi, Vaishali, and Katihar.\nIV.9.6 Acceleration/Deceleration\nThere was a slight acceleration in the growth rate of potato production at the state level (0.25%). Acceleration was observed in the north-west and east zones, while the south-west plains showed an accelerating decline. Major potato-growing districts with accelerated growth rates included:\nSamastipur: 0.55%\nBegusarai: 0.69%\nSaharsa: 0.25%\nGaya: 1.08%\nNalanda: 0.77%\nRohtas: 0.13%\nRanchi: 1.11%\nIn contrast, districts like Hazaribagh and East Champaran showed deceleration at (-0.31%) and (-0.70%), respectively. Saran and Nalanda also showed acceleration in their declining trends.\nIV.9.7 Area Under Potato\nThe area under potato in Bihar was 1.00 lakh hectares in 1970-71, increasing to 1.47 lakh hectares in 1976-77. It remained stagnant around 1.35 lakh hectares until 1986-87. By 1992-93, the area had expanded to 1.71 lakh hectares. The trend rate of growth was 1.85% during 1971-93\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>Bihar is a state in India that was the third largest in potato production during 1971-93, showing various trends in production growth and regional patterns)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UTTAR PRADESH<|>GEO<|>Uttar Pradesh is a state in India that led in potato production, ahead of Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEST BENGAL<|>GEO<|>West Bengal is a state in India with a significant potato production, having a higher growth rate than Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMASTIPUR<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar contributing significantly to the state's potato production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EAST CHAMPARAN<|>GEO<|>A key potato-producing district in Bihar with a notable growth rate in production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MADHUBANI<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar known for its potato production and high growth rate)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SARAN<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar contributing to potato production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEGUSARAI<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar with a significant share in potato production and the highest growth rate)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAHARSA<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar involved in potato production with an increasing trend)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAYA<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar notable for its contribution to potato production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NALANDA<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar with a significant potato production share)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROHTAS<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar contributing to the state's potato production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAZARIBAGH<|>GEO<|>A district in the Plateau zone of Bihar with a high growth rate in potato production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RANCHI<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar, part of the Plateau zone, contributing to potato production)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>UTTAR PRADESH<|>Bihar followed Uttar Pradesh in potato production ranking during 1971-93<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>WEST BENGAL<|>Bihar had a lower potato production growth rate compared to West Bengal<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAMASTIPUR<|>BIHAR<|>Samastipur is a key potato-producing district in Bihar<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EAST CHAMPARAN<|>BIHAR<|>East Champaran significantly contributes to Bihar's potato production<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MADHUBANI<|>BIHAR<|>Madhubani is recognized for its contribution to potato production in Bihar<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BEGUSARAI<|>BIHAR<|>Begusarai has the highest growth rate in potato production among districts in Bihar<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAHARSA<|>BIHAR<|>Saharsa contributes to the potato production in Bihar<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GAYA<|>BIHAR<|>Gaya is a significant potato-producing district in Bihar<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NALANDA<|>BIHAR<|>Nalanda contributes notably to Bihar's potato production<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROHTAS<|>BIHAR<|>Rohtas is involved in potato production in Bihar<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAZARIBAGH<|>BIHAR<|>Hazaribagh is a key district for potato production in the Plateau zone of Bihar<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RANCHI<|>BIHAR<|>Ranchi contributes to the potato production in the Plateau zone of Bihar<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
