Production of planting materials also included ornamental plants like Croton, Ashok, medicinal and aromatic plants, plantation crops, spices, condiments, and forest species. The KVKs also produced planting materials of flowers including marigold, tuberose, chrysanthemum, and dahlia.\nPlanting Material Production in Bihar\nKVKs in Accelerated Growth of Agriculture in Bihar and Jharkhand\nWith the technological support of State Agricultural Universities and guidance of Zonal Project Directorate vis-Ã -vis Indian Council of Agricultural Research, the KVKs of Bihar assessed a good number of technologies related to crop production, vegetable production, insect pest management, livestock rearing, and other relevant areas. Technologies found suitable for adoption were handed over to the extension mechanism, and feedback was sent to research organizations where modifications were needed. This process has definitely strengthened the ongoing efforts of the state government in improving the agricultural scenario of Bihar. Technologies which have found place in a large number of farmers' fields are given below:\nSystem of Root Intensification Method for Rice Cultivation\nDifferent KVKs assessed the effect of the SRI technique in rice cultivation. It was observed that the complete SRI technique produced higher yield along with higher net return in comparison to traditional practices. Through this technique, there was overall improvement in the number of tillers (per hill 30%), effective tiller per hill (25 to 30%), yield increase to the extent of 40%, followed by a 40% increase in net profit compared to traditional practices, along with saving of water and proper weed management in rice crop. In SRI method, 12-day-old rice seedlings are planted at a spacing of 25 cm x 25 cm against traditional transplantation of 30-day-old seedlings, resulting in higher yield and higher return.\nApplication of Zero Tillage\nThe assessment of zero tillage in enhancing profitability of wheat and paddy cultivation followed by timely sowing of wheat, conducted by KVKs, led to scaling up the technology across the entire state in collaboration with line departments and ATMA. The results of zero tillage showed that a 52% and 22% increase in yield in wheat and paddy, respectively, could be achieved over the conventional system.\nZero Tillage in Wheat Sowing\nIntroduction of vibrant Resource Conservation Technology (RCT), ZTT in Rice-Wheat dominated cropping system brought a drastic change in wheat yield. KVKs introduced ZTT in 2005 in a small area of about 5 ha only, and now it is being used in an area of about 1.00 lakh ha. It not only reduced sowing cost by about Rs. 2,500/ha but also advanced the sowing by 12-15 days and increased yield by up to 12% compared to the conventional method. Reduction in the cost of land preparation, seed, labor, weed management, irrigation, etc. led to nearly 65% more income for farmers than the conventional method.\nSahbhagi â A Promising Rice Variety for Drought-Prone Areas\nTo cope with scanty rainfall during the onset of kharif, an improved drought-tolerant and short-duration paddy variety, Sahbhagi, has been successfully introduced in drought-prone districts of Bihar, particularly in agro-ecological Zone IIIB. Due to the erratic nature of monsoon, drought is particularly frequent in rainfed uplands and shallow lowlands of Bihar. Average productivity is less than 1.5 t/ha in rainfed upland and less than 2 t/ha under shallow lowlands. The introduction of the Sahbhagi variety provided a yield advantage of 0.5 t/ha under moderate stress and 1.0 t/ha under severe drought conditions over traditional varieties of paddy and yielded at par with irrigated control conditions. The variety is resistant to leaf blast and moderately resistant to brown spot and sheath blight.\nRejuvenation of Guava Orchards\nDecline in productivity of guava trees occurs largely due to poor photosynthetic efficiency, besides several other compounding factors including the age of the tree, dense and intermingling branches, neglected and poor management of orchards, etc. Penetration and interception of sunlight in the canopy are greatly affected due to intermingling and overcrowding branches, leading to low productivity. KVKs have taken the initiative through FLD and training to rejuvenate old plants in 2012. Undesired and overcrowded branches are pruned to ensure better light penetration, improving photosynthesis and flowering capacity. Thus, productivity of guava increased by 9.37% through various training and FLD in the district. About Rs. 50,000/ha profit is being achieved by increased yield.\nGreen Manuring in Kharif Paddy\nIndiscriminate use and application methods of chemical fertilizer in Rice-Wheat cropping systems have started reducing soil productivity and health. To maintain soil productivity and health, the addition of leguminous crops is being propagated among farmers, which, on incorporation into soil, increases nutrient supply capacity, organic matter, microbial population, and also neutralizes pH. KVKs introduced green manuring (GM) in 2010 through various training and FLD in districts. It was found that GM saves about 39 kg N in paddy crop. Due to increased yield and soil health, this technology has spread to a vast area of paddy-producing districts.\nZero Tillage in Lentil for Tal Area of Bihar\nTal is a unique land situation in Bihar, which is monocropped and only lentil is cultivated in the rabi season. The clay soil of Tal area makes it difficult to plough,\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India where KVKs have implemented various agricultural technologies to improve crop production, vegetable production, insect pest management, livestock rearing, and other areas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JHARKHAND<|>GEO<|>A state in India mentioned in the context of agricultural growth alongside Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STATE AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Universities that provide technological support to KVKs in Bihar and Jharkhand for agricultural development)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZONAL PROJECT DIRECTORATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An entity that guides KVKs in Bihar and Jharkhand, under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, for agricultural improvement)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDIAN COUNCIL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A council that oversees agricultural research and development in India, involved in guiding KVKs in Bihar and Jharkhand)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SYSTEM OF ROOT INTENSIFICATION METHOD<|>EVENT<|>A technique assessed by KVKs for rice cultivation in Bihar, leading to higher yield and net return compared to traditional practices)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZERO TILLAGE<|>EVENT<|>A farming technique assessed by KVKs for wheat and paddy cultivation in Bihar, showing increased yield and profitability)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAHBHAGI<|>EVENT<|>A drought-tolerant and short-duration paddy variety introduced in drought-prone districts of Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GUAVA ORCHARDS REJUVENATION<|>EVENT<|>An initiative by KVKs to rejuvenate old guava plants in Bihar, leading to increased productivity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREEN MANURING IN KHARIF PADDY<|>EVENT<|>A technique introduced by KVKs in Bihar to maintain soil productivity and health by incorporating leguminous crops into the soil)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LENTIL CULTIVATION IN TAL AREA<|>EVENT<|>A unique agricultural practice in Bihar where lentil is cultivated in the rabi season using zero tillage due to the clay soil)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>STATE AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITIES<|>State Agricultural Universities provide technological support to KVKs in Bihar for agricultural development<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>ZONAL PROJECT DIRECTORATE<|>Zonal Project Directorate guides KVKs in Bihar under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>INDIAN COUNCIL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH<|>The Indian Council of Agricultural Research oversees agricultural research and development efforts in Bihar<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SYSTEM OF ROOT INTENSIFICATION METHOD<|>BIHAR<|>The System of Root Intensification Method was assessed by KVKs for rice cultivation in Bihar<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZERO TILLAGE<|>BIHAR<|>Zero tillage technique was assessed and scaled up by KVKs for wheat and paddy cultivation in Bihar<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAHBHAGI<|>BIHAR<|>Sahbhagi, a drought-tolerant paddy variety, was introduced in drought-prone districts of Bihar<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GUAVA ORCHARDS REJUVENATION<|>BIHAR<|>KVKs initiated the rejuvenation of old guava plants in Bihar to increase productivity<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GREEN MANURING IN KHARIF PADDY<|>BIHAR<|>Green manuring technique was introduced by KVKs in Bihar to improve soil health and productivity<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LENTIL CULTIVATION IN TAL AREA<|>BIHAR<|>Lentil cultivation using zero tillage in the Tal area is a unique agricultural practice in Bihar<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
