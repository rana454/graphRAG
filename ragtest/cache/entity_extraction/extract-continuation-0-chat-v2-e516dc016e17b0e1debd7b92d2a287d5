Consequently, the agriculture sector's share declined to 40.53% in 1989-90.\n1.3 Of the total population of 864 lakhs in 1991, around 278 lakhs (32.3%) were main workers in the state, of which 81.1% were engaged in agriculture either as cultivators or as agricultural laborers. With such an overwhelming size of workforce depending on agriculture and other sectors offering little scope to absorb the growing workforce, the policy thrust has to center largely around the expansion of the agriculture sector in the State. However, it is perceived that the performance of agriculture in Bihar, despite the vast potential, has been slender in the preceding few decades. For example, while the growth rate in foodgrains production during 1970-73 to 1990-93 was recorded at 2.60% as the all-India average, 4.83% for Punjab, 3.93% for Haryana, and 3.35% for Uttar Pradesh, it was only around 1.0% in Bihar. With a share of the population at 10.21%, the State contributed only 6.17% to the country's foodgrains output in 1990-93. Thus, while Punjab had a per capita per annum availability of foodgrains at 957 kg., followed by Haryana at 575 kg., it was only 121 kg. in Bihar in 1990-91, much less than the national average of 201 kg. per annum. Before policy prescriptions are suggested to augment agricultural production in the state, several questions arise regarding the status of agriculture and its growth across different agro-climatic zones in the state. Understanding the growth performance of major crops and input use patterns in the state is also crucial to assessing the development status of agriculture.\nObjectives of the Study\n1.4 The broad objectives of the present study are outlined as follows:\nTo examine the trend of growth in area, production, and yield of foodgrains and major crops in different agro-climatic zones and districts over time in the post-green revolution period.\nTo analyze cropping patterns and examine area shifts across major crops and crop groups.\nTo analyze the trend in land use patterns across different zones/districts.\nTo examine growth in input use across different agro-climatic zones/districts and its relationship with foodgrains production.\nTo analyze operational holdings and tenancy status in the State.\nMethodology\na) Data Base\n1.5 District-wise time series data on area, production, and yield of major crops, as well as aggregates of foodgrains, area under different land use classes, sources of irrigation, and the use of various inputs such as irrigation, fertilizers, and HYV seeds in agriculture were collected from the Directorate of Economics and Statistics, Government of Bihar, Patna. State-level data has been updated using various issues of the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), Mumbai. Data on credit flows were collected from published sources such as the Task Force Report, Statistical Statements relating to Co-operative Movement published by the National Bank, Currency and Finance of the Reserve Bank of India, etc. For analyzing operational holdings and tenancy status in the State, data from the Agricultural Census Report and various published studies/reports were used.\nb) Reference Period\n1.6 The performance of agriculture in Bihar was studied for the post-green revolution period in the country, i.e., since the early seventies. For state-level analysis, the beginning year was taken to be 1970-71. In the case of zones/districts, 1976-77 was taken as the beginning year, because it was from this year that the required data on area, production, and yield of crops was available for 31 districts considered for spatial analysis. The end year for analysis at the state level was taken to be 1992-93, the year for which the latest data was available. In the case of zones/districts, the end year was taken to be 1990-91, as data at the zone/district level was available up to this year. Since there was no abnormal rainfall in any of the years during the period under reference, data for all the years was considered for analysis. For analytical purposes, the period of study was divided into two sub-periods: the first sub-period was from 1970-71 to 1982-83 at the state level and 1976-77 to 1982-83 at the zone/district level. The second sub-period was considered as 1983-84 to 1992-93 at the state level and 1983-84 to 1990-91 at the zone/district level. The demarcation between the two sub-periods was made based on the distinct pattern of increase in foodgrains production observed from 1983-84.\nc) Selection of Zones/Districts\n1.7 The growth performance of Bihar agriculture has been studied at both the state and zone/district levels. The zonal classification, as defined by Rajendra Agricultural University, Pusa and discussed in Chapter II, has been adopted for this study. Selection of districts was complex due to changes since the early seventies. Bihar had originally 17 districts, which increased to 31 districts in 1973, 38 districts in 1978, 42 districts in 1990, and 53 districts in 1993. For this study, 31 districts as they existed in 1973-74 were considered, as the required data at the district level was uniformly available for these districts for the period under reference.\nd) Selection of Crops\n\n8 Study of Major Crops\nIn addition to studying foodgrain production as such, a detailed study was also\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India with a significant portion of its population engaged in agriculture, facing challenges in agricultural growth despite vast potential)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIRECTORATE OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS, GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR, PATNA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Responsible for collecting district-wise time series data on agriculture in Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTRE FOR MONITORING INDIAN ECONOMY (CMIE)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Provides state-level data updates used in analyzing Bihar's agricultural performance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESERVE BANK OF INDIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Source of data on credit flows for the study of agriculture in Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAJENDRA AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, PUSA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Defined the zonal classification adopted for the study of Bihar's agriculture)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DIRECTORATE OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS, GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR, PATNA<|>BIHAR<|>Collects and provides agricultural data for the state of Bihar<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CENTRE FOR MONITORING INDIAN ECONOMY (CMIE)<|>BIHAR<|>Provides data used in the analysis of Bihar's agricultural sector<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RESERVE BANK OF INDIA<|>BIHAR<|>Data from RBI used for analyzing credit flows in Bihar's agriculture<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAJENDRA AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, PUSA<|>BIHAR<|>University's zonal classification used for agricultural study in Bihar<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
