Maize occupies 6.49 lakh ha with production of 13.60 lakh tonnes and productivity of 2.1 tonnes/ha. Winter maize is popular in Bihar due to its high yield potential, and the area, predominantly under hybrid cultivation, is on the increase. The productivity of winter maize decreased from 3,094 kg/ha in 2004-05 to 2,641 kg/ha in 2005-06. The low productivity is mainly due to non-availability of adequate quantity of seeds of high-yielding hybrids. During Kharif, maize suffers from waterlogging and floods, while in autumn, the crop suffers from moisture stress. In the frontline demonstrations, average productivity of 6 tonnes/ha has been realized, with levels up to 8 tonnes/ha also recorded in farmersâ€™ fields. In view of this, proposed interventions for enhancing productivity are:\n(i) Seed production of QPM hybrids within the state.\n(ii) Cultivation of QPM hybrids HQPM-1, Shaktiman-1, Shaktiman-2, Shaktiman-3, Shaktiman 4; and normal grain single cross hybrids DHM 115, JH 3851, Prakash, HM 5; and HM 4 for baby corn.\n(iii) Winter maize as a better alternative to wheat under rice-wheat system due to rising temperature.\n(iv) Intercropping with potato, pea (for green pod), and vegetables in winter maize for additional income of Rs 6,000â€”12,000 per ha.\n(v) Promotion of maize-based processing industry (animal feed, corn oil, starch, ethanol, etc.).\nStrategy for Pulses:\n207. Bihar can play a major role in meeting Indiaâ€™s shortage of pulses. Its productivity in the state is greater than the All-India average. In the year 2006-07, in Bihar, it was 901 kg/ha while in India it was 473 kg/ha. Following strategies are proposed to further enhance its productivity:\n(i) Large rice fallow areas can be brought under Urad, Moong, and other pulses in order to increase farmersâ€™ income.\n(ii) Popularization of high-yielding varieties supported by a strong seed programme.\n(iii) Rehabilitation of gram in Agro-climatic Zone-I after the harvest of medium and late rice.\n(iv) Use of bio-fertilizer including Rhizobium.\n(v) Improving farm drainage to mitigate the problem of waterlogging.\nStrategy for Rapeseed-Mustard:\n208. Cooking oil is one of the major components in the Indian dietary system. Unfortunately, this has been in shortage. Fortunately, Bihar is in a position to supplement this shortage if proper strategy is adopted. Currently, the acreage under rapeseed-mustard in Bihar did not vary much during the last five years. Area, production, and productivity in Bihar presently are 0.82 lakh ha, 0.76 lakh tonnes, and 926 kg/ha, respectively. The major constraints in production are use of traditional varieties, inadequate moisture availability at sowing and late sowing of mustard, particularly in rice-fallow areas, broadcasting method of sowing and use of high seed rate, and pests like aphid, Bihar hairy caterpillar, Alternaria blight, white rust, and downy mildew. These issues could be tackled by suitable interventions. This would include:\n(i) Use of improved varieties of Indian mustard:\nEarly/timely sown: Sej 2, Pusa Mahak, and Pusa Bold.\nLate sown: Rajendra Rai Pichheti, Rajendra Anukool, Ashirvad; Toria: RAUTS 17, Panchali; and Yellow Sarson: Rajendra Sarson 1, Ragini, Benoy.\n(ii) Moisture conservation strategy and rainwater harvesting to ensure irrigation.\n(iii) Plant protection measures for controlling Alternaria blight, Bihar hairy caterpillar, and aphid.\n(iv) Production enhancement by apiary boxes in mustard fields.\n(v) Beekeeping as a pollinizer and also for additional income.\n(vi) Use of filler crops such as guava and custard apple and leguminous vegetables, turmeric, elephant foot yam as intercrop.\n(vii) High-density planting (200-225 plants/ha).\nOptimum Dates of Nursery Raising & Transplanting of Rice, and Sowing of Wheat and Other Rabi Crops\n209. Traditionally, rice was cultivated in high rainfall areas where water was abundantly available. In regions receiving 800 mm to 1200 mm rainfall, short-duration rice was cultivated in midlands and long-duration rice only in lowlands. Even though the farmers did not develop water resources for regular irrigation of the rice crop, they did utilize accumulated runoff water in ponds, lakes, rivulets, or any other local depressions for irrigating the rice fields either for field preparation or to protect the crop from withering during prolonged dry spells. The income associated with the adoption of high-yielding rice cultivars encouraged the farmers to cultivate rice in low to medium rainfall areas having assured irrigation supply. Thus, with the development of water resources for irrigation, rice cultivation spread to medium to low rainfall areas as well. However, high yields of rice could be obtained only by eliminating moisture stress through assured irrigation and better utilization of rainwater.\nEfficient Use of Modern Inputs\n210. An efficient and optimum use of modern inputs like quality seeds, chemical fertilizers, and other macro and micro-nutrients, is the key to productivity improvement on a sustainable basis. Therefore, farmers should be enabled to access and use modern farm inputs in an optimal and efficient manner. A mini kit programme is recommended for small and marginal farmers to enable them to increase productivity levels through the use of modern quality inputs\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
