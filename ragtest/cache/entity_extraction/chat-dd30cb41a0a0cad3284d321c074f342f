Agriculture growth was around 4.7 percent, which was above the national average of 3.6 percent, and in the latest five years, its performance was even more commendable, with an average annual growth rate of 7.1 percent. However, the agricultural productivity of two of its major crops, rice and wheat, is lower than the national average, despite the relatively high private investment in yield-augmenting inputs such as fertilizers, certified seeds, tube wells, and farm machines.\nBihar’s agriculture has diversified impressively through dairy development, although productivity in milk production is lagging behind other major milk-producing states. Poultry development has not taken off. In this paper, we study the composition, sources, and drivers of agricultural growth in Bihar with a view to identifying the factors that explain the paradox of low agricultural productivity and high use of productivity augmenting inputs. The study finds that poor public investment in power, all-weather roads, and marketing infrastructure have constrained agriculture in Bihar.\nIn particular, deficiencies in the power infrastructure have resulted in high dependency on diesel for pumping out groundwater for irrigation; this, along with soaring petroleum prices, has depressed returns from the cultivation of crops. Further, the proportion of surfaced roads in the state is one of the lowest in the country and needs attention in order to link farmers to markets. Another major difficulty that farmers in Bihar face is the lack of marketing infrastructure, resulting in their inability to reap the price incentives given by the Government of India in the form of minimum support price. Livestock development has not achieved its potential because of strategic deficiencies.\nIn dairy, productivity has remained low because germ plasm from superior breeds has not been used. In poultry, the culture of contract farming involving large integrator companies has not yet been adopted. In light of these findings, the study makes five principal recommendations to stimulate agricultural growth and productivity in the state, viz., improve the quality and quantity of rural power supply by strengthening transmission and distribution and obtaining separation of feeders for irrigation, increase in the intensity of surfaced roads in rural areas, improve procurement and marketing infrastructure, improve health and reproduction management of dairy animals, and obtain a quantum increase in poultry by employing the integrator model as has been done in states like Andhra Pradesh and Odisha.\n\nExecutive Summary\nBihar is endowed with abundant natural resources, especially fertile soil and groundwater. Yet, it is one of the poorest states in the country. Bihar's per capita income (Rs 15,506 in FY14) was around 39 percent of the all-India average (Rs 39,904 in FY14). It is even lower than Chhattisgarh (Rs 28,373) and Jharkhand (Rs 28,882) – the poorest states in the country. Moreover, it remains way below states like Sikkim (Rs 83,527), Maharashtra (Rs 69,097), Haryana (Rs 67,260), and Gujarat (Rs 63,168). In terms of poverty, 34 percent of Bihar's population is poor, compared to the all-India figure of 22 percent.\nA study by the World Bank (World Bank Report, 2008) shows that agriculture growth has the potential to reduce poverty faster than growth generated from other sectors. This is particularly so as 89 percent of poverty in Bihar is rural, and 74 percent of its workforce is dependent on agriculture. Bihar’s agricultural development in the last 10 years between 2005-06 and 2014-15 presents a mixed picture. Agricultural growth was around 4.7 percent, which was above the national average of 3.6 percent, and in the latest five years, its performance was even more commendable, with an average annual growth rate of 7.1 percent. However, agricultural productivity of two of its major crops, rice and wheat, is lower than the national average, despite the relatively high private investment in yield-augmenting inputs such as fertilizers, certified seeds, tube wells, and farm machines.\nBihar’s agriculture has diversified impressively through dairy development, but poultry development has not taken off, and its productivity in milk production is also lagging behind other major milk-producing states in the country. In this paper, we study the composition, sources, and drivers of agricultural growth in Bihar with a view to identifying the factors that explain the paradox of low agricultural productivity and high use of productivity augmenting inputs.\nThe study finds that in recent years, there has been an encouraging development towards diversification and the livestock sector, particularly dairy farming, has gained importance. The share of dairy products in the total value of output from agriculture and allied activities (GVOA) increased from 14 percent in TE 2003-04 to 23 percent in TE 2013-14, while at the all-India level, the share of dairy farming in GVOA remained at 17 percent in the same period. Between 2001-02 and 2013-14, milk production in Bihar increased from 2.7 million tonnes to 7.2 million tonnes, a CAGR of 7.9 percent. Despite this impressive growth in production, milk productivity in Bihar is lower than in some of the other states; for example, while Bihar’s productivity in milk production stood at 0.7 mt per lactating animal, Punjab’s productivity was 2.4 mt per lactating animal, Gujarat 1.1 mt per lactating animal, UP 1.0 mt per lactating animal, and MP 0.8 mt per lactating animal. The study finds that productivity of milk has remained low because germ plasm from superior breeds has not been used in Bihar.
