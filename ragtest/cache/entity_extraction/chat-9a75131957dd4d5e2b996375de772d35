The consumption was as high as 87.36 kg/ha in the south-west plains, followed by 55.04 kg/ha in the north-west and 50.11 kg/ha in the east plains during 1990-91. In contrast, the plateau zone had much lower consumption at 25.66 kg/ha.\nAmong districts, fertilizer consumption peaked at 135.86 kg/ha in Nalanda and 103.62 kg/ha in Begusarai, comparable to levels in Punjab, Haryana, and other agriculturally developed states. Districts such as Saran (81.80 kg/ha), Muzaffarpur (79.35 kg/ha), Vaishali (73.43 kg/ha), and Samastipur (68.92 kg/ha) in the north-west plains showed relatively high consumption. Conversely, Madhubani (18.85 kg/ha) and Darbhanga (33.93 kg/ha) had lower consumption.\nVIII.2 Composition of Fertilizer Consumption\nVIII.2.1 Imbalance in Nutrient Composition\nThe composition of chemical fertilizer is crucial as disproportionate use can adversely affect soil fertility. In Bihar, fertilizers were predominantly used for paddy and wheat. Comparing actual consumption with recommended doses revealed an imbalance. In 1970-71, nitrogen constituted 74.0% of fertilizer use against a recommended 56.0%. Though the share of nitrogen declined to 67.5% by 1992-93, it remained above the recommended level. Conversely, phosphorus consumption was deficient, increasing from 16.0% in 1970-71 to 22.5% in 1992-93, below the recommended 30%. Potash consumption was also deficient, remaining at around 10.0% compared to the recommended 14%.\nVIII.2.2 Regional Imbalances\nNorth-west Plains\nNitrogen consumption was excessive, exceeding 60% in most districts, though a few districts like Saran, East and West Champaran showed balanced consumption. Nitrogen consumption in Muzaffarpur, for example, decreased from 85.00% in 1976-77 to 65.37% in 1990-91.\nPhosphorus consumption was generally deficient, with shares less than the recommended 30%. Balanced phosphorus consumption was observed in West Champaran, Saran, and East Champaran. Potash consumption remained deficient, with East Champaran and Samastipur approaching balanced levels.\nEast Plains\nNitrogen consumption was relatively balanced, though high in Munger and Bhagalpur at around 70.0%. Declining trends were noted in Begusarai and Purnea. Phosphorus consumption was deficient in Munger with a share of 19.66%, but increased in other districts. Potash consumption was favorable, except in Bhagalpur and Munger.\nSouth-west Plains\nNitrogen consumption was high, with Rohtas being the only district showing balanced levels at around 60.0%. Phosphorus consumption was deficient, with shares around 20% in most districts, though it increased from less than 10.0% in 1976-77 to around 20.0% in 1990-91. Potash consumption was also deficient, with increases observed over the years.\nPlateau Zone\nNitrogen consumption exceeded 65.0% in most districts but showed a declining trend. Phosphorus consumption was close to the recommended dose, with increasing trends noted. Potash consumption was below 12.0% in all districts, with some districts showing further deterioration.\nVIII.3 Measure of Fertilizer Nutrient Imbalance\nThe index of nutrient ratio revealed significant imbalances in nutrient use, with the ratios of N/P and N/K much higher than the recommended base, indicating a deficiency in phosphorus and potash relative to nitrogen.\nNorth-west Plains\nImbalances in nutrient use were substantial, particularly in Sitamarhi and East Champaran. Samastipur and Gopalganj showed relatively fewer imbalances.\nEast Plains\nMunger and Bhagalpur had significant imbalances, while Saharsa and Katihar showed lesser deviations.\nSouth-west Plains\nAll districts exhibited high imbalances in nutrient ratios, particularly Patna, with ratios exceeding 250.0%.\nPlateau Zone\nImbalances were less severe compared to other zones, with lower deviations in districts like Singhbhum and Ranchi.\nVIII.4 Impact of Imbalance in Nutrient Use on Yield Levels\nThe unbalanced use of nutrients negatively impacted the yield levels of foodgrains, with elasticities of -0.35 for N/P and -0.42 for N/K, indicating adverse effects on yield.\nVIII.5 Relationship Between Fertilizer Consumption, Foodgrains Production, Irrigation, and Rainfall\nVIII.5.1 Fertilizer Consumption and Yield\nPositive elasticity of 0.23 was observed for the state. An increase in fertilizer consumption by 0.57 kg led to a 2.40 kg increase in foodgrains yield.\nVIII.5.2 Irrigation\nThe influence of irrigation on fertilizer consumption was significant, with elasticity of 6.14% at the state level and higher in specific zones like the south-west plains.\nVIII.6 Conclusions\nVIII.6.1 Overall Consumption Trends\nFertilizer consumption increased significantly from 21.01 kg/ha in 1982-83 to 57.20 kg/ha in 1992-93 but remained below levels in Punjab, Haryana, and the all-India average.\nVIII.6.2 Regional Consumption\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
