In districts with increased operated area, the rise was marginal. The combined effect of increasing operational holdings and decreasing operated area led to a decline in the average size of holdings across districts.\nXII.7 Surplus Land\nLand concentration issues are severe in Bihar, with 11.63% of the area owned and operated by just 0.64% large farmers. Land ceiling laws were imposed to address this issue, resulting in 197.9 thousand hectares of land being declared surplus. Of this, 168.0 thousand hectares were taken possession of and 119.4 thousand hectares were distributed as of January 1995.\nCompared to other major states, Bihar's land possession rate (84.87%) and land distribution rate (71.08%) are relatively low. Discrepancies in the declared surplus land and actual surplus land are significant, with government estimates of surplus land (158.9 thousand hectares) being much lower than actual estimates (731.0 thousand hectares). Only 21.67% of the estimated surplus land was acquired, and 14.77% was distributed.\nXII.8 Fragmentation of Land - Need for Consolidation\nThe problem of fragmented land holdings is significant in Bihar. The average number of fragments per holding ranged between 17 and 20 plots in 1980-81, likely increasing due to subdivisions. Fragmentation has led to extreme scattering of land holdings, creating manageability issues and necessitating leasing out of land.\nFragmentation hinders the application of modern technology, mechanical irrigation, and the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Consolidation of fragmented holdings is crucial for optimizing agricultural gains. Although consolidation programs were undertaken in several districts, they have largely stalled due to lack of political will and administrative efforts.\nXII.9 Concealed Tenancy\nInspired by the success of Operation Barga in West Bengal, tenancy reforms in Bihar are needed, especially considering the skewed land distribution and absentee landowners. Although the Bihar Tenancy Act aims to confer ownership rights to cultivators leasing land, its implementation has been ineffective.\nOral tenancy practices persist, often exploitative and providing little security to cultivators. Leased-in area estimates are grossly underestimated, with NSS data showing a decline from 14.50% in 1970-71 to 10.72% in 1981-82. Estimates by A.N. Sinha Institute and Hanumantha Rao suggest much higher concealed tenancy rates (50.0 to 60.0%).\nXII.10 Forms of Tenancy\nResearch indicates that one-third of tenants were pure tenants, while two-thirds were owner-cum-tenants. Pure tenants were mostly from scheduled castes or OBCs, while owner-cum-tenants included a larger proportion of OBCs and upper castes. Leasing out land was often caste-based and fragmented to circumvent tenancy laws.\nSharecropping was the dominant form of tenancy (97%) with fixed produce arrangements, while fixed cash systems were rare. Sharecropping arrangements were found to be exploitative, with tenants often receiving only 15.0% of net returns after deductions, compared to 35.0% for landowners.\nXII.11 Absentee Cultivation\n\nCHAPTER XII\nOPERATIONAL HOLDINGS AND TENANCY STATUS\nThe present chapter attempts to understand broad features of operational holdings as well as tenancy status in the State. It also examines the adverse influence of these on the status of agriculture in the State. Analysis is based on secondary data as available from census of agriculture and other published sources.\n\nI. Operational Holdings\nXII.2 Analysis of the Distribution of Operational Holdings\nAnalysis of the distribution of operational holdings by size class of farmers at different points of time shows that the marginal and small farmers, with their combined share at 86.75% in 1980-81, dominated in the State. The numerical presence of such categories of farmers was much more in Bihar compared to the national average of 76.23%. Moreover, while the numerical strength of marginal farmers was increasing rapidly from 48.74 lakh in 1970-71 to 85.12 lakh in 1980-81, the increase in the case of small farmers and semi-medium farmers was marginal. The medium and large farmers, on the other hand, showed a sharp decline in their numerical strength. Compared to the national average, the process of increase in the numerical strength of marginal farmers and decline of medium and large farmers was much sharper in Bihar.\nXII.3 Operational Holdings and Area\nThere were 117.1 lakh operational holdings with an area of 102.4 lakh hectares in the State in 1985-86. The average size of operational holding was only 0.87 ha. With a relatively large number of operational holdings and a low area under cultivation, the average size of operational holding (0.87 ha.) was much less for Bihar compared with states such as Haryana (2.75 ha.), Punjab (3.76 ha.), Andhra Pradesh (1.72 ha.), and Orissa (1.47 ha.). The average size of operational holding at the all-India level, at 1.57 ha., was much higher than in Bihar. Furthermore, the number of operational holdings was rapidly increasing in the State. While there were 75.8 lakh operational holdings in 1970-71, it increased to 117.1 lakh in 1985-86, recording an increase of 54.56% in one and a half decades. The increase was much higher in Bihar than at the national level (48.24%) during this period. Across different states, the increase in the number of operational holdings in Bihar was only next to Andhra Pradesh (\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
