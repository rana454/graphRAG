The first assessment should occur during the period of hatchery operation, and the second should occur six months later. The following are the water supply and quality parameters/requirements for a fish seed production unit.\nWater Parameters/Requirements\nWater Supply:\nAdequate, from a regular and dependable source.\nTypes of Water Sources:\nDirect groundwater (to be collected in an open pond before pumping).\nOpen water body such as rivers, streams, lakes, etc. (To be allowed only if found to be free from any kind of pollution/contamination.)\nWater Quality:\nFree from algal blooms.\nFree from pesticides and heavy metal contamination.\nFree from pathogens causing relevant diseases.\nTest report/analysis is mandatory and must be generated through standard test procedures. The report should be enclosed.\n\nAnnexure - V\nScreening for Pathogens and Disease\nScreening for Swimming and Food Acceptability\nActive:\nActively swimming in the water column, with non-directional movement.\nReady acceptability/immediate gulping of natural/artificial feed.\nInactive:\nSurface and sluggish swimming, circular range-bound motion.\nNo inclination for feeding.\nNote: Inactive seed should be less than 5%.\nScreening for Structural Abnormality\nNormal:\nStraight curvature distinctly differentiated into head, trunk, and tail.\nAbnormal:\nBent trunk and tail.\nNote: Structurally abnormal seed should be less than 1%.\nScreening for Diseases\nNo external sign of infections.\nScreening for Genetic Introgression and Hybrids\nNegative report in visual examination of morphological features (from fingerling stage onwards).\n\nAnnexure - VI\nInfrastructure Facilities for All Varieties of Fishes\nThe infrastructure facilities for hatchery and fish seed raising units should be indicative and not exhaustive, and may vary depending on different seed production facilities.\nThe appropriate level of flexibility can be allowed with respect to the construction and layout of the physical facilities at the time of verification, depending on local circumstances, provided that the specified capacities, water quality, and Brood stock assessment reports are compliant with the norms.\nComponents such as soil and water quality testing facilities, store rooms, staff quarters, and security systems are optional and should be built as per requirements and convenience.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
