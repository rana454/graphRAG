The subsequent period, however, witnessed acceleration in maize production in the state. It was only next to Uttar Pradesh in the volume of maize production. In terms of rate of growth, however, it lagged behind states like Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh.\nRegional Specificity: Maize production was region-specific with the east plains and north-west plains leading in production. Among the districts, Begusarai, followed by Samastipur and Saharsa, dominated in maize production. In terms of growth rate, while the east and north-west plains showed increasing trends, the south-west and plateau zones showed a reverse trend.\nYield Increase: Much of the increase in maize production emanated from increased yield levels, as the area under maize showed a declining trend.\nArea Decline: The declining trend in area was noticeable even in the east and the north-west plains, the dominant maize-growing zones.\nYield Improvement: The increase in the yield of maize was observed in all agro-climatic zones. However, it was impressively high in the east and the south-west plains. The districts witnessing impressive increases in maize yield included Madhubani, Muzaffarpur, Siwan, Vaishali, Begusarai, Katihar, Saharsa, Gaya, Nawadah, and Ranchi.\nIV.2.5 Tables\nTable IV.2.1: Area, Production, and Yield of Maize as Also Trend Growth Rate in Bihar\nTable IV.2.2: Compound Annual Rate of Growth\nIV.3 Wheat\nIV.3.1 Production\nWheat is the second most important cereal food crop for the state, next only to paddy, occupying 21.7% of the GCA and 33.4% of foodgrains output in 1990-93. The trends of growth in production, area, and yield of wheat across different zones/districts are analyzed in the following paragraphs.\nWheat production in the state was 4.12 lakh tonnes during the triennium 1958-61. Over the years, it increased to 12.39 lakh tonnes in 1968-71, 22.31 lakh tonnes in 1978-81, and 35.36 lakh tonnes in 1990-93. Wheat production in the state over three decades thus recorded a compound annual rate of growth of 6.90%. The rate of increase in wheat production during the recent period, i.e., 1983-93, was more impressive (4.34%) compared to the national average of 3.70% per annum. It compares well with major wheat-growing states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Punjab where the annual compound growth rate of production during the same period was recorded at 5.68%, 3.56%, and 3.79%, respectively.\nAnalyzing wheat production from 1970-71 to 1992-93, it is observed that wheat production in the state remained by and large stagnant, hovering around 24 lakh tonnes up to 1982-83. The year 1983-84 was a landmark for wheat production when it exceeded 29 lakh tonnes. It continued to rise since, touching 35.60 lakh tonnes in 1990-91. The trend rate of growth was 3.28% per annum for the period 1971-93. Between the two sub-periods, it was relatively high (3.50%) for the second sub-period and low (2.72%) for the first sub-period.\nIV.3.2 Regional Pattern\nAcross different zones, the north-west plains (40.93%), followed by the south-west plains (35.41%), dominated in wheat production. The east plains had a share of 21.61% in the total wheat production of the state. It was almost absent in the plateau zone with a share of 2.05% only. District-wise analysis suggests that production of wheat was by and large evenly spread among the districts of the north-west. However, in districts such as East Champaran (5.65%), Gopalganj (5.65%), Saran (5.44%), Siwan (5.27%), and West Champaran (4.00%), cultivation of wheat was relatively more dominant. Among the districts of the east plains, Begusarai (5.95%), Purnea (4.28%), and Saharsa (4.40%) emerged prominently in wheat production. Among the districts of the south-west plains, wheat cultivation was more widespread with a relatively high share in the state’s total wheat production. However, Rohtas followed by Bhojpur was found to be the main wheat granary of the state with a share of 9.92% and 7.43%, respectively.\nIV.3.3 Trend Rate of Growth\nAnalyzing the trend rate of growth, it is observed that during the first sub-period (1977-91), growth rate in wheat production in different zones was varied. It was highest in the north-west alluvial plains (3.68%) followed by the south-west alluvial plains (4.16%). The east alluvial plains had a growth rate of 2.66%, and the plateau region showed a decline of -2.77% per annum. The north-west and south-west alluvial plains showed a comparatively higher growth rate than the east alluvial plains and plateau regions. The rate of increase in production of wheat during the second sub-period (1983-91) in the north-west all\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
