Although total disbursement under KCC has increased almost 2.5 times, from Rs. 342 crore in 2002-03 to Rs. 815 crore in 2005-06, it still channels only a minuscule proportion of the total credit volume for crop loans.\nMicro-Finance Initiatives\nIn the area of micro-finance, more than 17,000 Self-Help Groups had been financed by banks up to 2005 through their priority lending schemes in 38 districts. The target for 2006-07 is to raise the number to 24,000 SHGs and advance Rs. 48 crore through the scheme. As of March 31, 2007, a cumulative number of 72,638 SHGs were credit-linked to banks, and the total credit flow to these SHGs worked out to Rs. 202.98 crore.\nInstitutional Credit Flow\nThe flow of credit for agriculture in the state from institutional sources from 2003-04 till 2005-06 (Annexure XXXIV) shows that total institutional credit in the agricultural sector in the state recorded an increase of almost 82% over the period. The main reasons for the improvement in agricultural credit disbursement in Bihar since 2003-04 may be attributed to the following developments:\nKisan Credit Card Package: Effective instrument for Commercial Banks and the RRBs to enter the crop loans segment.\nMillion Shallow Tubewells Programme (MSTP): A convenient platform for the CBs and the RRBs for increasing investment credit.\nGrowing Agriculture Sector: Since the late 1990s supported financing for Farm Mechanization in Bihar.\nGap in Credit Availability\nDespite this improvement in absolute terms, the availability of credit is far short of requirements. As mentioned in the Economic Survey (2006-07) by the Government of Bihar, the agricultural credit need was estimated to be Rs. 11,341.22 crore for Bihar in 2006-07. However, the credit target for agriculture set by banks for 2006-07 was only Rs 3,732 crore, which was much lower than the requirement. This gap between the target and actual disbursement of agricultural credit needs to be narrowed down, so that agriculture does not suffer for want of credit, ceteris paribus, and no such unfortunate events like farmers’ suicides and other miseries may take place.\nAccess to Institutional Credit\nSome 83 percent of Bihar farmers operating around 41 percent of the land own less than 1 ha. each. Even at the all-India level, the share of institutional credit during 2002 was only 61 percent. Various surveys show that a majority of marginal farmers have no access to institutional credit and have to depend primarily on non-institutional sources.\nSource: Sukhpal Singh & M.S Toor, Indian Journal of Agricultural Economics, Conference Number – Volume 60, No.3.\nMinikit Programme for Marginal Farmers\nAppreciating this problem, the Report of Dr. Sen Committee on Agriculture Production in Eastern India 1987 made a specific recommendation for a ‘minikit’ programme for marginal and small farmers for the Eastern region. The idea is that small/marginal farmers are given a small kit which contains the required quantity of seed, fertilizer, and even pesticide for a specific farm size along with instructions for use in the local language. The programme was taken up earnestly by West Bengal for summer rice during the late eighties and early nineties with very successful results. Under present Bihar conditions, the introduction of this programme both for rice and wheat is recommended.\nCommercial Cultivation of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants\nCommercial cultivation of medicinal and aromatic plants is already in vogue in the state of Bihar. Some of the important species include Periwinkle (Catharanthus), Gloriosa, Coleus, Phyllanthus, Aswagandha, Annona, Citronella, Palmarosa, and Geranium. A majority of these crops are being exported in bulk form. During the X Plan, medicinal and aromatic plants received focus with the setting up of the National Medicinal Plant Board and constituent State Medicinal Plant Boards.\nMushroom Cultivation\nMushroom cultivation in Bihar is not very popular as yet. There are, however, scattered examples of individual entrepreneurs having achieved success, and others are following them in and around Patna. Because of its profitability, particularly for landless and small marginal households, there is an urgent need to encourage its cultivation and marketing on commercial lines.\nSilk Production\nIndia produces a variety of silks called mulberry, ‘tassar’, ‘muga’, and ‘eri’ based on the feeding habit of the cocoons. Bihar is known for ‘tassar’ silk produced in the Bhagalpur area. This district offers great potential for silk development intervention through DIPP/VSE schemes which could provide the needed help. Since Bihar is more or less a new entrant, it should adopt the latest technology so as to be the leader in silk production. The producers will need technological, marketing, and credit support.\nReplication of Successful Farm Practices\nHisar Experiment – Wheat Technology\nDuring 2005-06, as much as 203 thousand hectares of land in Hisar district was brought under wheat cultivation. A total of 7.52 lakh metric tonnes of wheat at the rate of 37.04 quintals per hectare was produced. The challenge, therefore, was to increase wheat production so that the farmer rediscovers agriculture as a remunerative occupation and then continues to contribute to the central food pool. Scientists involved with the project pointed out that during the successive years wheat sowing was getting delayed due to a number of factors, resulting in the wheat grains getting affected by the rise in the day temperature when\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>KCC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kisan Credit Card, a financial product aimed at providing affordable credit to farmers in India)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SELF-HELP GROUPS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Groups financed by banks through priority lending schemes to promote micro-finance initiatives)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>State in India where agricultural credit flow and various developmental programs like MSTP and farm mechanization are being implemented)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MSTP<|>EVENT<|>Million Shallow Tubewells Programme, a platform for increasing investment credit in agriculture in Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FARM MECHANIZATION<|>EVENT<|>Supported financing initiative for agricultural development in Bihar since the late 1990s)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ECONOMIC SURVEY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A report by the Government of Bihar estimating the agricultural credit need)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUKHPAL SINGH<|>PERSON<|>Co-author of a report in the Indian Journal of Agricultural Economics regarding agricultural economics)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>M.S TOOR<|>PERSON<|>Co-author of a report in the Indian Journal of Agricultural Economics regarding agricultural economics)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DR.
