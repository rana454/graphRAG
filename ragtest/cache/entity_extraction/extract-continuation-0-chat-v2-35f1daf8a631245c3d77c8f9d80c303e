The annual per capita fish consumption in the state is one of the lowest in the country, less than 1 kg/yr for nutritional security. To promote fisheries, the Department of Fisheries has 121 fish seed farms, out of which only 10% are in working condition. Presently, there are 29 fish seed hatcheries in Bihar of which 2 are under the corporate sector, and 26 in the private sector. In order to bridge the gap in the fish seed demand and supply, the government of Bihar has announced to set up one hatchery in each District of the State.\nAquaculture\nBihar is blessed with aquaculture resources in the form of freshwater tanks and ponds which cover a water area of over 69,000 hectares. Freshwater aquaculture in the State is being promoted through District level Fish Farmers Development Agencies (FFDAs) which provide technical, financial, and extension support to the fish farmers. The FFDAs have so far brought under scientific fish farming over 26,000 ha in various districts with an average fish productivity of around 2.2 tonnes/ha.\nThe share of aquaculture in the total fish production in Bihar is 40%. Indian major carps and three Chinese carps contribute to almost the entire production from aquaculture. Though no systematic farming of other candidate species is carried out, some of the other species like scampi, act fishes (magur and singhi), different species of murrel, are also being cultured.\nBihar has vast potential for commercial scampi farming. In 2003, MPEDA has shown on an experimental basis, the production of scampi to the tune of 1500 kg/ha/four months in polyculture with carp. Bihar may be considered as the ‘sleeping giant’ for freshwater prawn farming. Realizing its importance as a candidate species for culture and export, it can be taken up on a large scale, for monoculture or polyculture practices.\nSocio-Economic Status of Fisher Population\nThe total fishermen population in Bihar is about 49.59 lakh, which is highest among the other states of India. About 50% (23.01 lakh) are engaged in fishing activities. The majority of these fishermen are of low-income and marginal status. The socio-economic status of fishers is very poor and they lack access to technology, finance, marketing, and other support services. This has resulted in low productivity and income. Improvement in the socio-economic condition of these fishers should be the prime agenda of the Department of Fisheries.\nPROCUREMENT, STORAGE AND PRICES\nA. Procurement & Price Support\nAgricultural production is a function of technical inputs—seed, fertilizers, and water, etc. In addition to these, remunerative prices are also an equally important adjunct in this production process. It was during 1965 that the Minimum Support Price (MSP) Policy was introduced. MSP is announced every year for all the major crops, taking into account all the relevant factors including the cost of production. It did serve as a catalytic agent in the success of the Green Revolution. This price is uniform for the country as a whole. Bihar is in a very peculiar situation. Because of low productivity, farming in Bihar is not a very profitable occupation. The net returns per hectare of paddy cultivation in Bihar (based on cash expenses plus imputed value of family labor) worked out to only Rs.3215 in 2003-04 as against Rs.19289 in Punjab (CACP, 2006). Based on C2 cost, the net returns from paddy cultivation were in fact negative, i.e., – Rs.1263. Thus, even if there is potential for raising the yield level in Bihar, low productivity and low profitability would stand in the way of realizing such potential. In fact, the ratio of gross value of output to A2FL was only 1.35 in Bihar, as against 1.99 in Punjab. Similarly, in the case of wheat, the net returns per hectare, based on A2FL, were only Rs.4787 in Bihar as against Rs.15946 in Haryana and Rs.15755 in Punjab. Based on C2 cost, the net returns from wheat cultivation were negative in Bihar, i.e., Rs.177. The ratio of gross value of output to A2FL was 1.47 in Bihar, 2.17 in Punjab, and 2.10 in Haryana.\n\nUnless paddy and wheat cultivation in Bihar is made profitable, farmers may not be induced to invest in land improvement measures for productivity growth and the much-desired acreage shift towards paddy and wheat in Bihar at the expense of area loss in Punjab and Haryana may not be forthcoming. Even maize does not seem to be a very promising crop in this regard. The net returns (gross value of output = cash expense plus imputed value of family labor, i.e., minus A2+FL) were only Rs.7625 and based on C2 cost, it was Rs.4450. The ratio of gross value of output to A2FL was 1.80. Even the neighboring state of Uttar Pradesh has relatively higher net returns from paddy and wheat cultivation. It would be further seen from (Annexure XXIX) that in several districts including Darbhanga, Katihar, Muzaffarpur, Nawada, Purnea, and Sitamarhi, there was hardly any change in total factor productivity at constant prices during the past three decades.\n\nThe frequent occurrence of floods and drought, as already stated, aggravates the problem further. The coefficient of variation in annual rainfall during 1980-81 to 2002-03 was 32 percent. Similarly, the prices of agricultural commodities fluctuate widely from year to\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DEPARTMENT OF FISHERIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A government department in Bihar responsible for promoting fisheries, managing fish seed farms and hatcheries to bridge the gap in fish seed demand and supply)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India with low per capita fish consumption, engaged in aquaculture and facing socio-economic challenges in the fishing community)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FISH FARMERS DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES (FFDAS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>District level agencies in Bihar providing technical, financial, and extension support to fish farmers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDIAN MAJOR CARPS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group of fish species contributing to almost the entire production from aquaculture in Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MPEDA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Marine Products Export Development Authority that conducted experimental scampi farming in Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MINIMUM SUPPORT PRICE (MSP) POLICY<|>EVENT<|>A policy introduced in 1965 to ensure remunerative prices for major crops across India, including Bihar)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEPARTMENT OF FISHERIES<|>BIHAR<|>The Department of Fisheries operates within Bihar to improve the fisheries sector<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FISH FARMERS DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES (FFDAS)<|>BIHAR<|>FFDAs operate in various districts of Bihar to promote scientific fish farming<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>INDIAN MAJOR CARPS<|>Bihar's aquaculture production is significantly contributed by Indian Major Carps<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MPEDA<|>BIHAR<|>MPEDA has shown the potential for scampi farming in Bihar through experimental cultivation<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MINIMUM SUPPORT PRICE (MSP) POLICY<|>BIHAR<|>The MSP Policy affects the agricultural production and profitability in Bihar<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
