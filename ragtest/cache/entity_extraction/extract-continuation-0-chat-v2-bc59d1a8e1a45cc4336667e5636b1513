Cropping intensity varies significantly across the state, with northern districts showing intensities between 1.65 and 2.24, while southern districts exhibit lower intensities of 1.6 or less.\nFactors Affecting Cropping Intensity\nThe lower cropping intensity in southern districts is partly due to water constraints, leading to post-kharif fallow periods. There is significant potential to increase cropping intensity by investing in traditional irrigation systems such as the Ahar-Pyne. However, agricultural intensification must be supported by adequate inputs, like water and fertilizers, to avoid reducing water productivity and negatively impacting rice yields.\n\nDiversification of Cropping Systems\nImportance of Agricultural Diversification\nDiversifying cropping systems not only improves yields but also enhances nutritional outcomes by providing a variety of nutritious foods throughout the year, aligning with SDG2.1. Diversification toward horticultural products (fruits and vegetables) and dairy products (milk, meat, and eggs) can boost incomes and contribute to nutritional security in Bihar.\nTypes of Diversification\nCrop Diversification: This involves reallocating land from staple cereals to other crops, such as coarse cereals, pulses, fruits, and vegetables. Diversification can occur by redistributing existing cultivable areas or bringing uncultivated areas, like fallow lands, into production.\nLivestock Diversification: Rearing small and large ruminants and poultry can provide additional income and supply protein-rich foods, including milk, eggs, and meat.\nRecent Trends and Factors\nRecent analysis of Bihar’s agricultural sector shows that diversification has been a key driver of crop output growth from 2001 to 2017. The shift toward growing coarse cereals, pulses, and commercial crops like sugarcane, linseed, and vegetables reflects this trend. The extent of successful diversification depends on:\nLand Productivity: The productivity level of the land influences the ability to change crop types.\nMarket Linkages: Strong market connections are crucial for the successful introduction and commercialization of diversified crops.\n\n \n5.3.1 Pulses\nImpact of the Green Revolution\nThe Green Revolution’s focus on rice and wheat led to a reduction in the cultivation of nutrient-rich coarse cereals and pulses. In Bihar, pulses now account for less than 10% of the gross cropped area. Between 2002–03 and 2016–17, the area under pulses decreased by 20%, despite increases in the minimum support price (MSP) and policy initiatives under the National Food Security Mission aimed at boosting pulse production and procurement.\nCurrent Status of Pulses in Bihar\nPulses contribute to less than 5% of the total food grain output in Bihar. Over the past five years (2014–19), the output of pulses has remained relatively stable. The productivity of pulses in Bihar is higher than the all-India average of 800 kg/ha, maintaining a steady rate of around 900 kg/ha as of 2018–19.\nRegional Distribution and Yields\nMore than half of Bihar’s pulse area and output is concentrated in the southwest and southeast agroclimatic zones. Districts such as Patna, Aurangabad, Nalanda, and Buxar are notable for their high pulse production and productivity. These regions benefit from favorable conditions for pulse cultivation, contributing to their leading status in the state.\n\nIt is largely rainfed, with very little cultivation taking place on irrigated land (Figure 5.24). Yields of pulses are constrained due to several factors, including:\nLow productivity lands\nFrequent pest and disease problems\nLack of assured markets\nInadequate irrigation\nCultivation on inferior lands\nLimited extension services and technology transfer\nOne of the main factors limiting yields of pulses is the lack of high-yield, short-duration seed varieties. The available stress-tolerant, high-yielding varieties need to be provided through improved supply chains. The lack of quality seeds is also reflected in the low seed-replacement ratio for pulses in Bihar (Figure 5.25).\nOpportunities for Diversification\nThe diversification into pulses can take place by bringing nearly 2.2 million hectares of rice-fallow land under pulse cultivation as a rice-lentil system. These lands have sufficient residual moisture for growth of short-duration pulses, like lentil, moong, urad, and lathyrus. Area expansion can also take place by:\nIntercropping short-duration pulses like moong or urad with sugarcane in the spring and summer.\nPromoting pigeon peas as post-monsoon pulses in northern Bihar.\nIntroducing black gram and moong bean as winter crops in rice-fallow areas of northeastern Bihar.\nInvestment is needed in infrastructure to reduce postharvest losses, which account for nearly 10 percent of the total pulse production. The relatively higher procurement price for pulses also offers an incentive for increasing the area and output of pulses (Figure 5.26).\nTARINA's Role in Diversification\n“One of the main factors limiting yields of pulses is the lack of high-yield, short-duration seed varieties. The available stress-tolerant, high-yielding varieties need to be provided through improved supply chains.”\nTCI’s Technical Assistance and Research for Indian Nutrition and Agriculture (TARINA) program has promoted a diversification of production systems by focusing on the cultivation of vegetables, pulses, and oilseeds in the Munger district of Bihar. This intervention aimed at increasing the availability and accessibility of nutritious foods for smallholder farming households.\nSMART Model Trials\nTARINA introduced the Sustainable Multi-species Agricultural Resources Model Trials (SMART) in Bihar. SMART develops mixed, sequential cropping models for farmers with small and marginal landholdings for the intensification of their production.
