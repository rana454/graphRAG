Belonging to an agrarian family, he had started farming in 2016. His family, owning only one acre of land, had leased three acres for agricultural activities. Mandal and his two brothers are engaged in farming.\nThe cultivation of conventional crops was failing to provide desired returns, prompting Mandal to start cultivating papaya and cauliflower to supplement his income. Previously, he had grown bananas extensively but discontinued banana cultivation due to the high prevalence of Panama wilt disease.\nMandal’s income from cauliflower cultivation, on average, ranged between Rs 80,000 to Rs 85,000 per hectare for early varieties. However, his profit from late cauliflower varieties, sown in the last week of December and harvested after mid-January, was generally low due to a sharp drop in cauliflower prices after mid-January. Considering discontinuing late cauliflower varieties, Mandal decided to start strawberry farming when the BAU team encouraged him, explaining how strawberry cultivation could increase his income. They informed him that sowing of strawberry plants could be done in late December, with fruits harvested from January onwards.\nUnder the project, in 2018-19, Mandal, along with two other farmers in his village, was provided 500 strawberry plants each free of cost for demonstration farming. The plants included Nabila and Camarosa varieties. Mandal was able to grow approximately 1.60 quintals of strawberries in his first year. Combined with the production of the other two farmers, the total strawberry production in Usmanpur village was around two quintals in the initial year.\nAlthough the first year’s production was encouraging quantity-wise, selling the produce proved slightly difficult due to the relatively unknown status of strawberries in the region. With assistance from the BAU team, growers managed to sell strawberries at a reasonably good rate of Rs 300 and above per kilogram through local contacts. Mandal’s net income from strawberry farming was approximately Rs 50,000 in the first year.\nIn the subsequent year (2019-20), Mandal and the other farmers purchased 4,000 strawberry plants each of Nabila and Camarosa varieties from Pune and Siliguri. Mandal’s second-year production was around four quintals, with the total production in Usmanpur village exceeding seven quintals. Mandal registered a net income of Rs 1.10 lakh from strawberry sales in the second year. The BAU team created a WhatsApp group to facilitate the online sale of strawberries, which helped avoid the selling difficulties experienced in the first year. Strawberry growers now receive an average supply order of 100 kilograms per day during the season. Mandal, sometimes flooded with orders, is unable to meet the demand. His annual net income from agricultural activities has almost doubled since starting strawberry farming, rising from approximately Rs 1.10 lakh to more than Rs 2.10 lakh in 2019-20. Due to the profitability, Mandal plans to expand strawberry farming and intends to grow Winter Dawn in addition to Nabila and Camarosa varieties this year.\n\n6. Sanjeet Kumar Singh\nAge: 40 Years\nVenture: Afforestation and Horticulture\nVillage: Baroun\nPanchayat: Darama\nBlock: Kawakol\nDistrict: Nawada\nEducational Qualification: Intermediate\nInstitution Facilitating Venture: Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Nawada\n\nFarmer Addresses Livelihood Issues Through Horticulture and Afforestation\nLife is much better now for Sanjeet Kumar Singh, a small farmer, compared to the past. Previously, due to a lack of adequate resources, life was challenging. However, Singh successfully resolved his livelihood problems through afforestation of his 10 katha barren land and by starting small-scale horticultural activities. He also engages in other activities to supplement his income, but horticulture and afforestation primarily address his family’s needs. Singh now earns more than three lakh rupees annually.\nForced to discontinue his education after intermediate due to financial problems, Singh migrated to Bengaluru and later to Delhi for livelihood following his marriage in 2002. He worked as a security guard in a private firm during his stay in Bengaluru and Delhi but was dissatisfied with his earnings. Returning to his village in 2004, Singh faced challenges finding suitable livelihood opportunities due to limited employment scope.\nKeen on agriculture as a livelihood source, Singh lacked concrete ideas about profitable farming practices. He initially established a poultry farm on land adjacent to his house. With 300 birds, Singh generated income from poultry business, but it was insufficient to meet his family’s needs and the educational expenses of his two sons and a daughter. Singh subsequently opened a general store and a cosmetic shop, now run by his wife, to supplement his income. These ventures led to a slight increase in income but it was through afforestation and horticulture that Singh achieved economic self-sufficiency.\nIn 2010-11, Singh participated in a training program on nursery raising and management organized by Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), Nawada. This training led him to explore earning a livelihood through afforestation. KVK scientists suggested agroforestry and horticulture as viable options. Singh discussed with scientists how to utilize his barren land, having been in contact with KVK since returning to his village. KVK had previously provided technical assistance for his poultry venture, including improved breed poultry birds for frontline demonstration.\nFollowing KVK’s guidance, Singh began afforestation of his barren land, which included forest department land adjacent to his property. He planted various fruit-bearing trees such as mango, guava, blackberry, jackfruit, wood apple, and vine fruit, along with wood-value trees. Singh received technical and scientific support and quality planting materials from KVK. Ensuring water availability for the trees was a major challenge due to the lack of a nearby water source.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MANDAL<|>PERSON<|>A farmer engaged in strawberry cultivation, who started farming in 2016 and has seen significant income growth from strawberry farming)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAU TEAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A team that encouraged Mandal to start strawberry farming and provided support for selling strawberries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USMANPUR VILLAGE<|>GEO<|>The village where Mandal and two other farmers initiated strawberry farming with the support of the BAU team)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NABILA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A variety of strawberry plant that Mandal and other farmers in Usmanpur village cultivated)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAMAROSA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Another variety of strawberry plant cultivated by Mandal and his fellow farmers in Usmanpur village)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUNE<|>GEO<|>One of the locations from where Mandal and other farmers purchased strawberry plants for cultivation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SILIGURI<|>GEO<|>Another location from where Mandal and other farmers sourced strawberry plants for their cultivation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SANJEET KUMAR SINGH<|>PERSON<|>A small farmer from Baroun village who improved his livelihood through afforestation and horticulture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KRISHI VIGYAN KENDRA, NAWADA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An institution that facilitated Sanjeet Kumar Singh's venture into afforestation and horticulture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAROUN<|>GEO<|>The village where Sanjeet Kumar Singh lives and engages in afforestation and horticulture)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MANDAL<|>BAU TEAM<|>The BAU team encouraged and supported Mandal in strawberry farming<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MANDAL<|>USMANPUR VILLAGE<|>Mandal is a farmer in Usmanpur village who contributed to the village's strawberry production<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NABILA<|>MANDAL<|>Mandal cultivated the Nabila variety of strawberries<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAMAROSA<|>MANDAL<|>Mandal also cultivated the Camarosa variety of strawberries<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUNE<|>MANDAL<|>Mandal purchased strawberry plants from Pune for cultivation<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SILIGURI<|>MANDAL<|>Mandal sourced strawberry plants from Siliguri as well<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANJEET KUMAR SINGH<|>KRISHI VIGYAN KENDRA, NAWADA<|>Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Nawada facilitated Sanjeet Kumar Singh's ventures in afforestation and horticulture<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANJEET KUMAR SINGH<|>BAROUN<|>Sanjeet Kumar Singh is a resident and farmer in Baroun village<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
