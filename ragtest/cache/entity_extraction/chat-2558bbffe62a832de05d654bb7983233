The study finds that productivity of milk has remained low because germ plasm from superior breeds has not been used in Bihar. For example, the exotic/crossbred female cattle population in Punjab is 91.5 percent of the total female cattle population, while that of Bihar was only 32.9 percent in 2012. The potential yield from cross-bred cows is much higher than that from indigenous breeds. On average, a cross-bred cow yields 7.2 liters a day nationally, but in Punjab, a typical cross-bred cow yields about 11.2 liters a day, while in Bihar, it is only 6.5 liters a day. This means, cross-bred yield in Bihar is almost half of the yield in Punjab. The production trait of milk-producing cattle in Punjab is better than in Bihar because of the use of germ plasm from superior breeds in cross-breeding in the former.\nAlthough the dairying sector is growing in importance in Bihar, food grain cultivation continues to be significant. The cropping pattern in Bihar has not undergone much change over the years in as much as cereals remain dominant, accounting for about 79 percent of the acreage. Although the production of the two main crops grown in the state – rice and wheat – has increased over the years, productivity of these two crops has remained below the national average. In fact, Bihar’s productivity in rice (2.0 mt/ha in TE 2014-15) is lower than the national average of 2.4 mt/ha and much lower than states like Punjab (4 mt/ha), Haryana (3.2 mt/ha), Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh (3.0 mt/ha). Similarly, wheat yields in Bihar (2.2 mt/ha) are lower than the national average (3 mt/ha) and much lower than states like Punjab (4.7 mt/ha), Haryana (4.3 mt/ha), and Rajasthan, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh (3 mt/ha).\nThis trend of rice and wheat yield lagging behind the national average is striking when seen against the trends in the use of yield-enhancing assets and inputs. For example, irrigation coverage in Bihar is around 68.5 percent of the gross cropped area as compared to the national average of 47.6 percent (2012-13). Consumption of fertilizer has also been increasing over the past decade. According to the data made available by the Fertilizer Association of India (FAI), the apparent consumption of fertilizers in the state is around 199.7 kg per hectare against the all-India figure of around 130.8 kg/ha (2012-13). Mechanization has also been making progress in Bihar with a robust expansion in the use of zero tillage machines from just 126 machines in 2008-09 to 9,760 units in 2013-14, a CAGR of 106.5 percent. Similarly, combine harvesters have increased from 55 units in 2008-09 to 261 units in 2013-14, a CAGR of 29.6 percent. Another significant development has been a rapid increase in the seed replacement rates of the three major crops. In the early 2000s, Bihar’s seed replacement rates for paddy, wheat, and maize were as low as 6.3 percent, 8.4 percent, and 21.2 percent respectively, but these have increased to 38 percent, 34.8 percent, and 100 percent respectively by 2011-12.\nIrrigation, fertilizers, quality seeds, and mechanization are the main inputs required to improve the productivity of crops. Currently, Bihar is on par with or above the national average in the utilization of all these inputs, and yet there is a yield gap. The paradox here is that despite investment by farmers in technology and inputs, their returns are low. Like Kishore, Sharma, and Joshi (2014), we too find that poor public infrastructure and poor incentive structure has negated the benefits of private investments in irrigation, fertilizer use, mechanization, and certified seed use and has kept productivity of crops low. For example, Bihar has an ultimate irrigation potential (UIP) of about 10 million ha, of which surface water irrigation potential (major, medium, and minor) is about 6.2 million ha, and groundwater potential is about 3.8 million ha. Although UIP created until 2012-13 is about 7.6 million ha (5.3 million ha through surface irrigation and 2.2 million ha through groundwater), utilization is only about 4.2 million ha or 55.7 percent of the UIP. This is due to poor transmission and distribution infrastructure, among other reasons. Similarly, although the intensity of road coverage is much higher in Bihar than in other states, the proportion of surfaced roads (which are all-weather roads) is one of the lowest. Further, the state’s marketing infrastructure is weak, resulting in its farmers’ inability to reap the price incentives given by the Government of India in the form of minimum support price (MSP). The incidence of government procurement is negligible in Bihar – only about 3 percent of the rice and wheat output is procured by the government.\nAlthough the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act has been repealed in Bihar in 2006 with the objective of facilitating free trade, infrastructure to support a competitive market is grossly\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
