While there were 75.8 lakh operational holdings in 1970-71, it increased to 117.1 lakh in 1985-86, recording an increase of 54.56% in one and a half decades. The increase was much higher in Bihar than at the national level (48.24%) during this period. Across different states, the increase in the number of operational holdings in Bihar was only next to Andhra Pradesh (71.22%). The matter becomes even more serious when examining the trend in the growth of the size of operational holding. While most states, including Punjab, Haryana, West Bengal, and Andhra Pradesh, showed an increase in the size of operational holding, albeit marginally, in Bihar, Orissa, and Uttar Pradesh, it showed a declining trend. The level of decline (-10.85%) was, however, much more significant in Bihar during this period. The decline in the size of operational holding in the State could be seen largely in the declining net sown area on the one hand and increasing current fallow and barren land on the other. As the area of operational holdings of marginal farmers increased from 18.38 lakh ha. in 1970-71 to 25.79 lakh ha. in 1976-77 and 29.56 lakh ha. in 1980-81, the increased number of marginal farmers in the State over these years could be attributed to growing subdivision and marginalization processes, with semi-marginal and small farmers turning increasingly into marginal farmers. Again, the sharp decline in the number of large farmers could partly be seen in the implementation of land ceiling laws in the State.\nXII.4 Size of Operational Holdings for Marginal Farmers\nThe average size of operational holdings for marginal farmers in Bihar at 0.35 ha. was relatively less compared to the national average of 0.39 ha. in 1980-81. Over the years, however, the average size of operational holdings for such a category of farmers does not seem to have reduced significantly. The fact that 75.81% of the farmers had a mere 0.35 ha. as average holding size gives cause for concern, more on account of the viability question. This seems to have given rise to the phenomenon of reverse leasing where marginal farmers lease out land to bigger size farmers.\n\nII. Regional Pattern in Operational Holdings\nXII.5 Distribution of Operational Holdings Across Districts\nAnalysis of the number of operational holdings across different zones/districts suggests that there was a large skewness in the distribution of land in districts such as Purnea, Muzaffarpur, and Gaya. It was relatively much less in districts such as Katihar and Nawadah. The number of operational holdings did not seem to be related to the density of population as well as the number of households. Analysis further suggests that the number of operational holdings increased significantly in most of the districts. The rate of increase in the number of operational holdings over the decade 1971-81 was as high as 154.05% in Muzaffarpur, 86.42% in Purnea, 140.07% in Gopalganj, 84.08% in Sitamarhi, and 71.45% in Palamu. Amidst such an increasing number of operational holdings, however, Nawadah (-4.45%) showed a decline in the number of operational holdings during the same period. In the case of Aurangabad, Singhbhum, Samastipur, Munger, Saharsa, Katihar, and Ranchi, the increase in the number of operational holdings was relatively much less. This could be attributed largely to partial implementation of land consolidation in these districts.\nXII.6 Shrinkage in Operated Area\nIn most of the districts, the operated area showed a shrinkage. The shrinkage in the operated area was as high as (-35.71%) in Nawadah, (-20.67%) in Madhubani, (-21.24%) in Samastipur, (-28.43%) in Munger, and (-39.85%) in Saharsa. In the case of districts showing an increase in operated area, the increase was observed to be marginal. The decline in operated area, along with the increasing number of operational holdings, resulted in a declining average size of holding in all the districts.\n\nIII. Surplus Land\nXII.7 Land Concentration and Ceiling Laws\nThe problem of land concentration has been acute in the State, with as much as 11.63% of the area being owned and operated by just 0.64% of large farmers. It warranted imposition of land ceiling and distribution of the surplus land among the potential beneficiaries. As a result of the stringent land ceiling laws, a total of 197.9 thousand hectares of land have been declared surplus in the State, of which 168.0 thousand hectares were taken possession of, and 119.4 thousand hectares were distributed as of January 1995. Compared to other major states, however, the land possession rate as well as land distribution rate has been relatively low at 84.87% and 71.08% in Bihar. While the land ceiling laws as such have been found to be adequate, serious doubts have been expressed about their implementation. The surplus land declared by the Government was observed to be grossly understated. According to Bharati, while the surplus land declared by the Government was 158.9 thousand hectares, the estimated surplus land was around 731.0 thousand hectares. Thus, the gap between the estimated surplus land and declared surplus was almost 4.5 times. Against the estimated surplus land, only 21.67% was found to have been acquired, and 14.77% was distributed.\n\nIV\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
