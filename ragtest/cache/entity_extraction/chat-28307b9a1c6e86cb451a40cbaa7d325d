Enhancing market density, promoting FPOs, and expanding road infrastructure are crucial.\nWomen’s Role and Nutritional Outcomes\nWomen can influence the crop mix for both household consumption and market sale. Ensuring that women are included in agricultural transformations aligns with SDG 2.3.\nFood Safety-Net Programs\nImprovements in yields and diversification can increase the supply of micronutrient-rich foods in Bihar’s food safety-net programs, such as ICDS, MDM, and PDS. Efforts should be made to ensure all eligible households are covered and to increase local processing and food safety regulations.\n\nRole of Women’s Empowerment for Improved Nutrition\nSDG2.1 focuses on ensuring access to nutritious foods throughout the year by all members of households. To achieve an equitable intrahousehold distribution of food that meets the nutrition requirements of all individuals, there must be:\nAn adequate quantity of food at the household level\nAdequate quality of food available\nAn understanding of the nutrition needs of different members of the household\nDistribution of food according to the needs of each member of the household\nWomen play an important role in all these areas. The pathway from women’s empowerment to improved nutrition can be examined using various direct and indirect indicators, such as women’s education and control over income, and the extent to which women have input in decisions related to agricultural production, food purchases, preparation, and consumption.\nEmpirical Evidence\nEmpirical evidence suggests that empowering women improves nutrition for mothers, their children, and other household members. For example, more than half of reductions in all child stunting from 1970 to 1995 can be attributed to increases in women’s status. Some studies have found that women’s discretionary income has a greater impact on child nutrition and food security than men’s, and among agriculture interventions that have improved nutrition, women’s active involvement has been a consistent element.\nSDG5 and Women’s Empowerment\nWomen’s empowerment is a key component of the SDGs. “Women’s empowerment is essential for supporting transformations to sustainable development.” In fact, SDG5 calls for gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls. In this chapter, we focus on a set of areas in which the status and/or participation of women can directly or indirectly influence nutritional outcomes, and therefore, determine the progress toward achieving SDG2 in Bihar. This is founded on women’s ability to influence intrahousehold food distribution, based on existing social norms, knowledge, skills, and how decision-making power is shared within households.\nBox 6.2: TCI–TARINA Research on the Empowerment–Nutrition Pathway in Munger, Bihar\nTCI–TARINA estimated empowerment levels of women involved in agricultural activities in Munger, Bihar based on the Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI). After adapting the WEAI to the agricultural context of India, it was found that more than 80 percent of women in agricultural households are disempowered across five domains of agriculture: input, resources, control over income, leadership, and time use. The main drivers of this disempowerment are a lack of membership in agriculture-related self-help groups and a lack of ownership of agricultural land.\nBox 6.1: Women and Nutrition Outcomes\nTCI–TARINA research indicates women play an important role in determining nutritional outcomes. This can be seen in terms of their input in decisions related to the purchase and preparation of food. They are also key influencers in accessing health care for themselves and their children.\nWomen’s Empowerment in Agriculture\nWhile increasing yields and diversification will influence food availability at the household level, women’s ability to access resources and make decisions in various spheres of agriculture, like production, marketing, sales, and so on, can have implications for their nutritional outcomes and that of their households. This is because women can influence the availability of food by having inputs in the mix of crops that are cultivated. They can play an important role in influencing which types of crops will be grown and sold, and which types of allied activities that the household should engage in, like livestock rearing or kitchen gardens. This is especially true in Bihar, where women constitute a dominant share of the agricultural workforce. Women can also influence how income is spent on food purchases and their time spent in agriculture can impact time available for childcare and food preparation activities.\nSDG2.3 and Bihar’s Agricultural Roadmap\nSDG2.3 focuses on increasing productivity and incomes of women farmers “including through secure and equal access to land, other productive resources and inputs, knowledge, financial services, markets and opportunities for value addition and non-farm employment.” A similar recognition of the role that women play in agriculture and an emphasis on facilitating their empowerment in agriculture by ensuring access to inputs, equipment, and credit, in addition to strengthening self-help groups, is also reflected in Bihar’s agricultural roadmap.\nImpact of Women’s Empowerment on Dietary Diversity\nWomen’s input and decision-making in agricultural activities can influence how land is allocated to the cultivation of different crops, holding the potential to move away from the state’s predominantly cereal-centric production patterns toward one that incorporates nonstaples. Such a diversification of the cropping pattern can take place on the field or in the form of kitchen gardens/vegetable gardens.\nData source: TARINA Baseline Survey, 2017\nFor a given level of household per capita food purchases, we find that women who are empowered in agriculture have significantly higher dietary diversity scores, as compared to women who are disempowered. More specifically, women’s ability to influence production decisions and membership in self-help groups correlate with improved dietary diversity.\n\nWomen’s Economic and Social Security\nEconomic and social security for women is integrated into several state government schemes, including:\nLakshmibai Social\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
