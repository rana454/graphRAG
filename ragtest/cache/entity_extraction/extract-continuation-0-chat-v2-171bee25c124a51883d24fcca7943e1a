Amidst this scenario, however, there were districts showing increased yield. They included:\nBegusarai (1.78%)\nBhagalpur (0.57%)\nMunger (1.84%)\nBegusarai and Bhagalpur showed a reversal from a declining trend in the first sub-period to an increasing trend in the second sub-period. On the other hand, districts such as Saharsa, Purnea, and Katihar showed a reversal from an increasing trend in the first sub-period to a declining trend in the second sub-period. Munger continued to show a declining trend in both sub-periods.\n\nV.11 Conclusions\nIV.11.16 Analysis thus suggests the following broad conclusions in respect of trend and pattern of growth in tobacco production in the State:\nBihar's Status in Tobacco Production\nBihar was one of the major tobacco-growing states until the early seventies. However, by the early nineties, this status was relegated to the background. While most of the major tobacco-growing states recorded impressive increases in tobacco production, Bihar showed a declining trend during the eighties.\nDecline in Production\nThe decline in tobacco production was largely due to a sharp decline in yield of tobacco, as the area under tobacco recorded an increasing trend.\nRegional Production\nTobacco production in the State was region-specific, with the north-west plains being the major producer, particularly the districts of Vaishali and Samastipur, which produced the lion's share.\nYield Comparison\nWhile most districts showed lower yields of tobacco, some districts compared well with the national average. However, yields were much lower compared to Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh.\nMajor Districts\nBoth Samastipur and Vaishali, the major tobacco-growing districts, showed an increasing trend in tobacco production with both area and yield showing an increasing trend.\nConcern Over Declining Trend\nSeen in the context of the state being traditional in tobacco production, its declining trend in tobacco production is a serious cause of concern.\nTable IV.11.1\nArea, Production, and Yield of Tobacco in Bihar during 1971-93\nTable IV.11.2\nCompound Annual Rate of Growth (%)\nFigures in parentheses indicate the level of significance.\n\nCHAPTER V\nCROPPING PATTERN AND AREA SHIFTS ACROSS DIFFERENT DISTRICTS\nThe question of which crop dominates in area coverage and the trend and pattern of area shifts across different crops over time in Bihar is significant, particularly in the context of growing emphasis on crop diversification and commercialization. The following paragraphs address these questions. Analysis of cropping patterns across different zones/districts has been made using data on the area under different crops/crop groups over time. The percentage share of different crops/crop groups in total cropped area is taken to reflect the cropping pattern. Analysis of area shifts across different crops/crop groups has been made at the state level, considering the period from 1970-71 to 1992-93. The trend rate of growth in the percentage share of different crops/crop groups during the period under reference is taken to reflect the direction and rate of shift in area across different crops/crop groups.\nCropping Pattern\nV.2 Analysis of area under different crops/crop groups, as well as their percentage share in the state in 1988-91, indicated that food crops dominated agriculture with a share of 91.77% in the total cropped area. Non-food crops formed a low share at 8.23%. Among the food crops, cereals constituted as high as 80.50%, and pulses 11.27% of the total cropped area. Among the cereals, crops such as paddy (50.58%), followed by wheat (20.57%) and maize (7.13%), were the most important. Among pulses, gram constituted 1.53%, arhar 0.68%, and other pulses 9.06%.\nAmong non-food crops, a wide range of crops were produced in the state. However, the most important ones were:\nRapeseed/mustard (1.10%)\nLinseed (0.72%)\nJute (1.53%)\nPotato (1.74%)\nSugarcane (1.48%)\nBesides, cash crops such as tobacco (0.16%), chillies (0.07%), turmeric (0.03%), and coriander (0.02%) were also important in a few pockets of the state.\nV.3 Analysis of cropping patterns across different zones/districts suggests that while in the plateau zone, the paddy crop (66.38%) alone was dominant among cereal crops, in other zones such as the north-west, south-west, and east plains, wheat was also an important cereal crop with its share at 24.7%, 27.27%, and 19.03%, respectively. Additionally, maize formed a significant proportion in the north-west (7.57%) and the east alluvial plains (11.81%). It is further observed that while paddy and wheat were cultivated in almost equal measure in all the districts of the plains, cultivation of maize was specific to select districts such as Samastipur, Saran, Vaishali, Begusarai, Bhagalpur, Saharsa, and Palamu.\n\nV.4 Analysis of Area Under Pulses\nAnalysis of the area under pulses across different zones/districts suggests that while pulses were cultivated in all zones/districts, some zones/districts were more prominent in their cultivation. The zones of:\nSouth-West (16.43%)\nEast Alluvial Plains (11.98%)\nwere relatively more dominant in pulse cultivation. Districts that figured prominently in pulse area included:\nDarbh\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BEGUSARAI<|>GEO<|>Begusarai showed a reversal from a declining trend to an increasing trend in tobacco yield during the study period)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BHAGALPUR<|>GEO<|>Bhagalpur showed a reversal from a declining trend to an increasing trend in tobacco yield during the study period)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUNGER<|>GEO<|>Munger continued to show a declining trend in tobacco yield in both sub-periods)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAHARSA<|>GEO<|>Saharsa showed a reversal from an increasing trend to a declining trend in tobacco yield)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PURNIA<|>GEO<|>Purnea showed a reversal from an increasing trend to a declining trend in tobacco yield)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KATIHAR<|>GEO<|>Katihar showed a reversal from an increasing trend to a declining trend in tobacco yield)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>Bihar was one of the major tobacco-growing states until the early seventies but showed a declining trend in tobacco production during the eighties)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VAISHALI<|>GEO<|>Vaishali, along with Samastipur, is a major tobacco-growing district in Bihar with an increasing trend in tobacco production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMASTIPUR<|>GEO<|>Samastipur, along with Vaishali, is a major tobacco-growing district in Bihar with an increasing trend in tobacco production)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BEGUSARAI<|>BIHAR<|>Begusarai is a district in Bihar that showed a reversal to an increasing trend in tobacco yield<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BHAGALPUR<|>BIHAR<|>Bhagalpur is a district in Bihar that showed a reversal to an increasing trend in tobacco yield<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MUNGER<|>BIHAR<|>Munger is a district in Bihar that continued to show a declining trend in tobacco yield<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAHARSA<|>BIHAR<|>Saharsa is a district in Bihar that showed a reversal to a declining trend in tobacco yield<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PURNIA<|>BIHAR<|>Purnea is a district in Bihar that showed a reversal to a declining trend in tobacco yield<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KATIHAR<|>BIHAR<|>Katihar is a district in Bihar that showed a reversal to a declining trend in tobacco yield<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VAISHALI<|>BIHAR<|>Vaishali is a major tobacco-growing district in Bihar with an increasing trend in production<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAMASTIPUR<|>BIHAR<|>Samastipur is a major tobacco-growing district in Bihar with an increasing trend in production<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
