An efficient and optimum use of modern inputs like quality seeds, chemical fertilizers, and other macro and micro-nutrients, is the key to productivity improvement on a sustainable basis. Therefore, farmers should be enabled to access and use modern farm inputs in an optimal and efficient manner. A mini kit programme is recommended for small and marginal farmers to enable them to increase productivity levels through the use of modern quality inputs. Government can take advantage of available funds under Food Security Mission and procure quality HYV seeds for wheat, hybrid rice, and maize for this purpose. The services of progressive farmers may be used to produce quality seeds, and also delivery services for the supply of other inputs should be strengthened. Rural credit is another grey area. Small/marginal farmers are invariably deprived of institutional credit â€“ it is only 29 percent of total agricultural credit. All possible efforts should be made to provide the required inputs directly under the mini kit programme. Linkages with SHG is another successful approach.\nPopularization of Multi-Crop Zero-Till Seed Drills\n211. The Zero-till Seed Drills, developed at Pantnagar in the 1990s, are being produced by several manufacturers and are getting inducted into rice-based cropping systems for seeding wheat and other winter (Rabi) crops. As the farmers are accustomed to sow wheat in highly pulverized fields, sometimes they prefer the use of zero-till seed drills for seeding wheat after one or two tilling by cultivator or country plough. As the soils of harvested rice fields in eastern India contain high moisture, zero tillage technology for sowing wheat, lentil, and oilseed crops has been found highly useful in timely seeding, reducing the cost of production, and increasing crop yields. The tractor owners, however, discourage the use of this machine in order to increase the operating hours of their tractors and the associated benefit from it. There is a need to enhance the pace of adoption of the multi-crop zero-till seed drill by organizing large-scale demonstrations.\n\nIntensive Training to Farmers about Modern Crop Production Technologies\nScientists from the Department of Agriculture, Krishi Vigyan Kendras, State Agricultural Universities, and ICAR Institutes should be engaged to impart training to farmers in their villages on modern crop production technologies. Retired scientists may also be engaged on this venture. Some specific educational programmes are listed below:\n(i) Training to farmers about improved rice production technology including cultivars, seed rate, nursery raising, and plant population at the time of transplanting, field preparation, and balanced use of fertilizers, optimum water regime, and weed and pest management.\n(ii) Training to farmers about improved wheat, maize, pulses, oilseeds, and other Rabi crop production technologies including cultivars, and nutrient, weed, water, and pest management.\n(iii) Training and demonstration about seed production technologies of different crops.\n(iv) Educating farmers about the use of low energy water application (LEWA) and other pressurized irrigation equipment.\n(v) Educating farmers about the use of zero till seed drills, planters, reapers, and threshers.\n(vi) Training about grain storage systems and value additions.\n(vii) Demonstrations of improved Rice, Wheat, Lentil, Bengal Gram, Potato, and vegetable production technologies.\nManagement of Natural Resources\nThe state has 5.71 million ha of cultivated area, of which 3.43 million ha (61%) has assured irrigation. The soils are deep alluvial, but suffer due to salinity/alkalinity and nutrient deficiencies of sulphur, boron, and zinc. Occasional flooding and imperfect drainage affect crop growth. Rice, wheat, and winter maize are predominant crops of the state. The productivity of different crops in the state is less than the national average. The total food grains production is 7.7 million tonnes. Suggested interventions for natural resource management for agriculture in the state are as follows:\n(i) Site-specific nutrient management on 0.5 million ha to produce additional 2.6 million tonnes of food grains.\n(ii) Introduction of pulses and oilseeds on rice fallows with supplementary irrigation facility.\n(iii) Zero tillage on 1.5 million ha having excess soil moisture after rice harvest to enhance production by 0.45 million tonnes.\n(iv) Promotion of quality protein maize having tremendous food and feed potential.\nManaging Risk: Agriculture and Natural Disaster\n(i) Need to develop robust decision support systems and agriculture advisory services\nWith adequate dissemination of weather and price information, it would be possible for small farmers to decide a priori on:\n(a) The crop to cultivate in a particular season.\n(b) The price hedging mechanism which would be best suited for the product.\n(c) The credit or investment required for growing, holding, or transporting the â€˜rightâ€™ crop.\nThere is a need to develop and deliver bundled risk management solutions for small and marginal farmers to hedge through futures trading and production risk management by way of index-based insurance in line with the focus on providing Comprehensive Risk Management for vulnerable groups. There is a need to engage in pilot projects to understand the following:\n(a) The best channel/medium and infrastructure required to convey the need for a Decision Support System for price risk hedging among poor producers.\n(b) The role of formal price risk and weather risk hedging services like National Commodities Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX) in hedging against price risks of small and marginal farmers.\n(c) The most efficient mechanism in providing formal production risk hedging mechanisms (index-based insurance). The weather insurance being a cover for covariant weather shocks and not idiosyncratic household risks specific to the farmer.\n(d) The provision of price risk products through a â€˜Decision Support Systemâ€™ coupled with an insurance cover could prove to be an ideal risk management strategy for poor households.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
