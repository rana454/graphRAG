More than 300 food processing units were started in the state during the second agriculture roadmap.\nThe third agriculture roadmap paved the way for the renovation and development of government agricultural market yards, with work on renovation started in 22 agricultural produce market yards. Basic infrastructure such as internal roads, drainage systems, toilet blocks, high mast lights, etc., were developed in these market yards. To bridge the information gap between farmers and markets, the department also started the collection and dissemination of price and arrival data from 100 market nodes.\nFourth Agriculture Roadmap (2023-28)\nThe fourth Agriculture Roadmap in the state envisages the strengthening and development of the agricultural marketing ecosystem by providing systemic interventions, creating enabling infrastructure, and assisting various stakeholders. For a holistic development of the agricultural marketing ecosystem in Bihar, an action plan for the overall development of government agricultural market yards, promotion of agricultural exports, strengthening of the farmer producer organization ecosystem, and development of rural hats will be implemented. The Department of Agriculture will implement various proposed activities with the following objectives:\na) To enable the farmers of the State to increase their access to remunerative markets\nb) To strengthen the agricultural marketing ecosystem by improving market infrastructure and providing other enabling infrastructure for agribusinesses to flourish\nc) To promote the export of agricultural produce from the State by developing and strengthening the agri-export ecosystem\n\n\n\n4. To Increase the Use and Adoption of Digital Initiatives to Enhance Efficiency and Transparency in the Agricultural Marketing Ecosystem\nSummary of DPRs for Proposed Activities\nDevelopment of Government Agricultural Produce Market Yards\nRecognizing the importance of agricultural produce market yards in the state, the government has prioritized the work of renovation and modernization of all 54 market yards in the state under the fourth agriculture roadmap. These market yards will be linked to the e-NAM platform, which will facilitate the integration of these market yards with a common national-level online marketing platform, facilitating pan-India trade of agricultural commodities from these market yards.\nTo provide real-time market information, the existing system of collection of price and arrival data through the AGMARKNET platform will further be strengthened by integrating the AGMARKNET portal with the BIHAN App of the Government of Bihar and developing a state-level information and intelligence platform.\nThe department has prepared a comprehensive policy for the allotment of assets in the market yards (Bihar Policy for Allotment of Assets in Agricultural Produce Market Yards) which will ensure the allotment of assets in the agriculture market yards in a fair, transparent, and inclusive manner. The Policy for allotment of assets in the market yard has been included in the DPR for development of government agriculture market yards. Community institutions like Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs)/Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and their federations have been provided preferential treatment in the allotment of assets by making provisions for reservations and relaxations in eligibility conditions.\nFurther, the department will also bring a policy for the management and maintenance of market yards. Provisions of this policy will ensure the long-term sustainability of the assets being created in market yards.\nTo facilitate activities related to the marketing of agricultural products in the state and ensure that farmers can get fair and remunerative prices, a ‘Directorate of Agricultural Marketing’ will be established within the department. The directorate will implement various proposals and other marketing-related schemes and policies envisaged under the Agriculture Roadmap and will work closely with farmers, traders, and other stakeholders.\nThe initiatives related to the development of government agriculture market yards will support farmers in getting remunerative prices, provide impetus to the food processing industry in the state, and will create opportunities for employment generation in the state.\nDevelopment of Rural Hats\nAfter the repeal of the ‘Agricultural Produce Marketing Act’ in 2006, the bulk of the transactions of agricultural products shifted to the farm gates. It has led to the emergence of small unorganized wholesale and consumer markets commonly known as rural hats. These hats function as periodic markets and operate mostly twice or thrice a week. As per the report of the Standing Committee on Agriculture (2018-2019), about 1,794 Grameen Haats exist in Bihar. The lack of basic infrastructure and facilities such as platforms, covered sheds, storage facilities, drinking water, and sanitation facilities leads to significant losses of agricultural produce and also restricts the functioning of these markets.\nImproving the infrastructure facilities in these haats will increase the efficiency of these haats through efficient price discovery, reduced transaction costs, and increased competition between buyers and sellers. These haats will also be linked with the larger market yards, improving the efficiency of market yards by integrating the supply chain of commodities. These initiatives will facilitate higher price realization for farmers, minimize post-harvest losses, and develop a competitive market closer to the farm gate.\nPromotion of FPO Ecosystem in Bihar\nAgriculture in the state is dominated by small and marginal farmers who face multiple challenges related to small volumes of marketable surpluses and limited access to critical agricultural inputs and services. Recognizing these needs of smallholders, the collectivization of smallholders through farmer-producer organizations (FPOs) has gained substantial momentum in the state in the last few years.\nHowever, most of the FPOs in the state are in a nascent stage and are facing multiple challenges related to capacity building, access to credit, and market linkage. The Government of Bihar will work for the overall development of the FPO ecosystem in the state and will take steps to address the multiple challenges being faced by FPOs and other stakeholders.\nPromotion of FPO Ecosystem in Bihar\nThe Government of Bihar has prepared an umbrella policy (Bihar FPO Promotion Policy) for facilitating the development of the FPO ecosystem in Bihar. The policy will support building an enabling environment for the promotion of sustainable Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) in Bihar and will support\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
