The increasing trend accelerated in the north-west zone from 1.54% in the first sub-period to 2.01% in the second sub-period. However, in the east alluvial plains, the declining trend accelerated from (-0.69%) in the first sub-period to (-5.80%) in the second sub-period.\nIV.11.10 Among the districts, the area under tobacco showed an increasing trend in districts such as:\nDarbhanga\nMuzaffarpur\nSamastipur\nSitamarhi\nBegusarai\nVaishali\nThe growth rates ranged between 1.84% and 4.99%. Districts showing a decline in area included:\nSaran\nMadhubani\nEast Champaran\nSiwan\nMunger\nBhagalpur\nSaharsa\nThese districts showed declines ranging between (-0.71%) and (-30.08%). Both the dominant tobacco-growing districts, Vaishali and Samastipur, showed expansion in their area. Districts such as Begusarai, Siwan, and Sitamarhi, which were less dominant in production, recorded expansion in their area.\niii) Yield of Tobacco\nIV.11.11 Performance in the yield of tobacco was not encouraging in the state. It was 890 kg/ha in 1970-71, showing ups and downs in subsequent years. The maximum yield was 1270 kg/ha in 1987-88. The yield started declining afterwards, reaching only 570 kg/ha in 1992-93. The rate of growth in yield was positive at 1.30% per annum during 1971-93. It showed an increasing trend (1.23%) in the first sub-period and a declining trend (-2.98%) in the second sub-period. The yield of tobacco in Bihar was lower compared to the all-India level and major tobacco-producing states. It was 1370 kg/ha at the all-India level, 1220 kg/ha in Andhra Pradesh, 1730 kg/ha in Gujarat, and 3640 kg/ha in Uttar Pradesh in 1990-93, as against 650 kg/ha in Bihar. The growth rate had been positive at the all-India level as well as in those states during the eighties, while it was negative in Bihar.\nRegional Pattern\nIV.11.12 Zone-wise/district-wise analysis of the yield of tobacco as a triennial average in 1988-91 showed that it was relatively higher in zones/districts with high tobacco production. For example, it was the highest at 1.02 t/ha in the north-west plains, the dominant tobacco-growing zone, and 0.90 t/ha in the east plains. Across different districts, yield was not necessarily high in districts producing more tobacco. For example, it was only 0.95 t/ha in Vaishali, the major tobacco-growing district, but 1.3 t/ha in Madhubani, a lesser producer of tobacco. Other districts showing high yield of tobacco included:\nDarbhanga (1.19 t/ha.)\nGopalganj (1.0 t/ha.)\nSamastipur (1.55 t/ha.)\nWest Champaran (1.0 t/ha.)\nIV.11.13 Analysis of the trend rate of growth in tobacco yield across different zones suggests that while the north-west alluvial plains showed an increasing trend (3.04%), it was declining (-1.43%) in the east alluvial plains during 1971-91. Yield recorded an increasing trend in both zones in both sub-periods. However, the rate of growth increased from 1.09% in the first sub-period to 2.09% in the second sub-period in the north-west plains, and it showed accelerated growth from 2.58% in the first sub-period to 4.11% in the second sub-period in the east plains.\nIV.11.14 The trend rate of growth was positive across different districts of the north-west alluvial plains during 1977-91, ranging from 2.13% to 6.23%. All these districts continued to show an increasing trend in yield even during the second sub-period. In some districts, it even accelerated to higher growth levels. Such districts included:\nMadhubani (9.65%)\nDarbhanga (6.25%)\nIn the case of Samastipur, it reversed from a high rate of declining trend (-5.07%) in the first sub-period to an increasing trend (5.02%) in the second sub-period.\nIV.11.15 Districts of the east alluvial plains, on the other hand, presented a contrasting picture, where most showed a declining trend rate of growth in yield of tobacco during 1977-91, ranging from (-1.99%) to (-2.53%). Amidst this scenario, however, there were districts showing increased yield. They included:\nBegusarai (1.78%)\nBhagalpur (0.57%)\nMunger (1.84%)\nBegusarai and Bhagalpur showed a reversal from a declining trend in the first sub-period to an increasing trend in the second sub-period.
