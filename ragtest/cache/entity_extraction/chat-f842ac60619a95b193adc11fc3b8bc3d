In practice, the nutrition-related activities of a department would feed into and reinforce the activities of other departments, and vice versa, empowering them all to better meet their nutrition-related goals. For this to work, a focus on nutrition security needs to be explicitly incorporated in the objectives and activities of the various government departments and ministries at both the central and state levels. To some extent, this is visible in Bihar government’s map of various centrally and state-sponsored schemes that contribute to the subgoals of SDG2. However, that map shows that individual departments like Consumer Affairs, Health, and Woman and Child Development (WCD) operate in silos, rather than working together to achieve a shared goal.\nConvergence in Objectives at the Subnational Level\nConvergence in objectives at the subnational level is critical for progress toward SDG2, since states play an important role in the design, implementation, and monitoring of policies on the ground. Implicit in such a localization of goals is the setting of nutrition-related targets at the local level. While the NITI Aayog recognizes the importance of a localized approach for achieving the SDG targets, it falls short on a union of objectives, especially at the local level. For instance, in the SDG India Index, each state’s performance on the SDGs is analyzed relative to national-level targets. Setting targets at the district level would make it easier to galvanize resources and ensure coordination. At the moment, district-level institutional mechanisms for collaboration between departments and sectors are in a nascent stage, especially with regard to implementation.\nBihar State Nutrition Action Plan 2019\nThe Bihar State Nutrition Action Plan 2019 outlines a workplan for achieving the nutrition goals of the World Health Assembly, as well as the SDGs, through its Manav Vikas Mission. The plan envisages a three-level administrative and monitoring framework for reducing malnutrition at the ward, district, and state levels. It recognizes the relevance of identifying vulnerable families and individuals at the ward level as a starting point to ensure that the various departmental schemes reach their intended beneficiaries. The implementation of the latter is expected to occur under the purview of the district administration, while the overall state plan will be overseen by a state-level Empowered Body on Nutrition.\nConvergence in Implementation\nA convergence of objectives around nutrition security needs to be followed by convergence in implementation on the ground. Teams from various departments should work together on a joint program of action through interlinked, coordinated activities, from the central level to the village level. At the village and district levels, teams should implement site-specific policies in a coordinated manner. At the grassroots levels, district-level bodies, like the District Development Coordination and Monitoring Committee (DISHA), and village-level bodies, like the Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committees (VHSNCs) and Village Education Committees (VECs), need to be empowered with key responsibilities to ensure the implementation of policies related to nutrition security.\nStakeholder Engagement\nTo achieve policy convergence, the Bihar government must enlist all stakeholders with a role to play in transforming nutritional outcomes in the state. Within the government, this includes the Departments of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries on the production side, the Department of Food and Consumer Protection for procurement, and the Departments of Health, WCD, and WASH for programs related to nutrition awareness and behavior change. Additionally, convergence will also require the expertise of local development organizations, cooperatives like Sudha Dairy, and private sector players for markets and value chains. Finally, community-level platforms like self-help groups can be relied on for community mobilization and for layering the livelihood–agriculture–nutrition strategies discussed earlier in this report. Civil society can also contribute to this effort. The state (under the chief secretary) and district (under the collector/district magistrate) must make special efforts to ensure the participation and commitment of all relevant stakeholders. In all the above programs, engaging with the Panchayat and Department of Urban Affairs will be critical for the achievement of goals.\nMapping Departmental Roles\nIn Table 8.1, we map out how the roles played by different departments fit within the four quadrants of the TCI framework. For each department, we mention the specific central- and/or state-level schemes that are relevant, and in subsequent columns, highlight to which aspect of the agriculture–nutrition pathways they can contribute. The pathways are color-coded to reflect in which of the four quadrants they refer: Q1 – household income; Q2 – access to diverse foods year-round; Q3 – intrahousehold food allocation; and Q4 – nutrient absorption.\nChallenges in Nutritional Outcomes\nIt is imperative to recognize that the slow progress toward improving nutritional outcomes, despite a number of policies and programs focusing on women, child health, and nutrition, is in part because of the lack of convergence and coordination between social safety-net programs, agricultural policies, and food security programs. For meeting the targets of SDG2, specifically, the Vision Document emphasizes the production and delivery of food grains and the absorption of nutrients therein. Bihar’s SDG Vision Document outlines a three-pronged approach to achieving its targets for SDG2. This focuses on:\nGains in agricultural productivity as outlined in the third Agriculture Roadmap (2017–22);\nImprovement in nutritional status through MDMs, ICDS, and the National Health Mission (NHM); and\nAchieving food security by way of the National Food Security Act (NFSA)/TDPS.\nPolicy and Programmatic Convergence\nIn this chapter, we use the TCI–TARINA food systems framework presented in this report to provide an illustration of concrete options for policy and programmatic convergence at the state, district, and village levels to achieve nutrition security in Bihar.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
