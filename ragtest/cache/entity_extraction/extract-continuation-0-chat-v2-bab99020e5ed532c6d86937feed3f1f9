It was found that GM saves about 39 kg N in paddy crop. Due to increased yield and soil health, this technology has spread to a vast area of paddy-producing districts.\nZero Tillage in Lentil for Tal Area of Bihar\nTal is a unique land situation in Bihar, which is monocropped and only lentil is cultivated in the rabi season. The clay soil of Tal area makes it difficult to plough, and if sowing is not completed within the shortest possible time, the soil becomes very hard due to fast loss of moisture. Being bowl-shaped and situated behind natural cleaves, drainage of water is dependent on evaporation only. Zero tillage in sowing lentil promoted by KVKs has performed exceedingly well in the Tal area and has been widely adopted by the farmers of Tal area in Bihar. Paira cropping is a dominant practice in lentil cultivation in some districts of Bihar. In low-lying areas (commonly known as ahar), lentil is sown after the depletion of soil moisture in the last week of October to November. In heavy clay soil, large clods form during field preparation. Application of zero tillage has not only made it possible to cultivate lentil but also produced nearly 200% more yield.\nDirect Seeded Rice by Zero Tillage for Resource Conservation\nRice cultivation in Bihar during kharif is highly dependent on rain, which delays nursery raising, transplanting, and sowing of succeeding crops like wheat. Moreover, rice being a water-loving crop, yield is influenced by the availability of irrigation throughout the growing period. Shortage of labor, particularly during land preparation and transplanting, further aggravates the problem, and consequently, the cost of cultivation goes up. Direct seeding of rice through zero till-cum-seed drill is an effective means to overcome the problems of rice cultivation during moisture stress situations. The KVKs have successfully demonstrated the technology with a reduction in water (15 to 20%) and labor requirements. Higher rice yield has also been recorded to the extent of 39 percent with enhanced profitability.\nCultivation of Kharif Onion for Higher Profitability\nHeavy rain in the pre-monsoon period followed by a long dry spell during the monsoon period has been a common feature in the last two years in most of the districts of Bihar. The erratic climatic conditions during the monsoon have forced farmers to take another crop in fallow land or a smaller portion of their main crop land. KVKs have conducted FLDs on kharif onion. Introduction of this alternate crop in kharif by the KVKs has helped a good number of farmers in getting adequate remuneration.\nVermi-Compost\nTo minimize the use of chemicals in agriculture operations, KVKs have put their efforts into producing bio-fertilizers, bio-agents, etc. The KVKs, through their training and demonstration programs, have involved young farmers in vermi-compost-based enterprise development followed by large-scale production by small farmers for its use, mainly in vegetable crops. This has also resulted in the effective utilization of farm waste/agricultural waste for the benefit of the overall agricultural environment.\nAzolla Culture\nPresently, a few KVKs, namely Samastipur and Vaishali, have introduced azolla culture for increasing rice production. Azolla culture fixes atmospheric nitrogen in rice fields, which results in a significant increase in rice yield. The dry azolla has been utilized for livestock also to enhance milk productivity.\nPapaya Intervention\nPapaya (Carica papaya) is a very important fruit crop grown commercially in the Begusarai district. It is one of the best crops that flower and fruit throughout the year. This is highly profitable to farmers. Before the attempts made by KVK, the cultivation of papaya was almost nil in Begusarai. The KVK has introduced the papaya variety, Red Lady. It is a high-yielding variety with good market value and keeps farmers in good profit. KVKs have trained farmers on the cultivation of this variety, and now it has gained significant popularity among farmers in the district.\nImprovement in Sheep Rearing\nThe indigenous sheep rearing practice has been modified to improve the yield of milk and meat production. This has led to an increase in milk yield from 400 liters per year to 550 liters per year and meat yield from 15 to 20 kg per year. Farmers have also been encouraged to adopt improved breeds of sheep which are more productive.\nTurmeric Cultivation\nTurmeric cultivation was introduced in the state through KVKs in districts such as Darbhanga and Samastipur. The variety adopted has shown good results with increased yield and market value. The technology was spread among the farmers through FLDs and training programs, resulting in higher profitability.\n\nKVKs in Accelerated Growth of Agriculture in Bihar and Jharkhand\nRole Played by KVK Towards Agricultural Development in Jharkhand\nBackground:\nJharkhand as the 28th State of Indian Union got recognition on the 15th November, 2000.

The total geographical area of Jharkhand is 79,714 sq.km surrounded by Bihar in the North, West Bengal in the East, Odisha in the South, and Chattisgarh in the West. The state is located on an elevation of 300 to 610 msl and the climate ranges from dry semi-humid to humid semi-arid types.
