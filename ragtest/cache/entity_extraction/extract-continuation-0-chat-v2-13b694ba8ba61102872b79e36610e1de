Districts like Patna and Begusarai showed levels comparable to more prosperous states.\nVIII.6.3 Nutrient Imbalance\nFertilizer use was disproportionate, with excess nitrogen and deficient phosphorus and potash. Imbalances had a negative impact on foodgrain yields.\nVIII.6.4 Influence of Fertilizer and Irrigation\nFertilizer consumption positively impacted yield, and irrigation significantly influenced fertilizer use across different zones and districts.\n\nCHAPTER IX\nGROWTH IN IRRIGATION - TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL ANALYSIS\nThe expansion and improvement in the irrigation network occupy a central role in agricultural development strategy, as it augments land productivity on the one hand and brings stability in agricultural output on the other. Bihar has been endowed with vast irrigation potential. The ultimate irrigation potential for the State is estimated at 6.50 million hectare metres for major/medium irrigation. However, the potential created was only 43.0% in respect of major/medium irrigation by 1990-91. The case of minor irrigation was no better. According to the Ground Water Irrigation Commission, the State has 2.67 million hectare metres of groundwater as utilizable for irrigation. As against this, the net draft, i.e., level of groundwater development, was only 25.46% in the State. This leaves enough scope for expansion of minor irrigation potentials in the State. In this context, several policy questions arise:\nHow has the irrigation expanded across different agro-climatic zones/districts over these years?\nWhat has been the efficiency of irrigation?\nTo what extent has it facilitated increased use of bio-chemical technology?\nHow has it influenced the yield and hence agricultural output in different regions?\nWhy is irrigation not expanding despite vast potentials?\nWhat are the major constraints for investments in irrigation in the State?\nThe following paragraphs address these questions on the basis of data on irrigation as available from secondary sources.\n(i) Expansion of Irrigation\nIX.2 The net irrigated area in the state increased only marginally from 28.74 lakh ha. in 1976-77 to 33.05 lakh ha. in 1990-91, an expansion of 11.50% only in 15 years. The net irrigated area formed only 42.85% of net sown area in 1990-91, as against 93.5% in Punjab, 76.05% in Haryana, and 60.92% in Uttar Pradesh.\nIX.3 Of the several sources of irrigation, tubewell (42.0%) was followed by canal (33.0%) which dominated the irrigation network in the State. Irrigation through wells and ponds formed an insignificant proportion. Analysis of the growth in different sources of irrigation suggests that while tubewell showed expansion (2.37% p.a.), all other sources, including canal, showed shrinkage with their share in total irrigation showing a declining trend.\nIX.4 Analyzing the availability as well as expansion of irrigation across different agro-climatic zones, it was observed that the south-west plains were highly irrigated (81.14%), quite comparable to the States of Punjab and Haryana. Districts of this zone, except Patna, showed relatively high irrigation levels, exceeding 80.0%. Patna had an irrigated area at 60.94% only. Net irrigated area showed an increasing trend (0.66%) during 1977-91 in this zone. The rate of increase was high in Rohtas (2.32%). Patna, Nawadah, and Gaya, on the other hand, showed a declining trend in net irrigated area.\nIX.5 The level of irrigation was almost similar in the north-west and east plains at 45.19% and 41.73%, respectively, in 1990-91. Among the districts of these zones, Begusarai (70.55%), followed by Siwan (70.37%) and Saran (68.68%) had relatively high levels of irrigation. However, districts such as Purnea (23.87%) and Katihar (29.54%) of the east plains; and Madhubani (21.15%) and Sitamarhi (23.69%) in the north-west plains had the least coverage of irrigation. In terms of growth in the irrigated area, districts such as Purnea (6.02%), Katihar (6.69%), Vaishali (5.75%), and Darbhanga (5.96%) showed impressive performance.\nIX.6 The plateau districts, on the contrary, showed low irrigated area at 7.19% only in 1990-91. Of the districts falling under this zone, Palamu showed a relatively high level of irrigation (21.75%). In all other districts, it was less than 10.07% of the net sown area. The level of irrigation showed shrinkage in all the districts ranging between (-)12.15% as in Dhanbad and (-)0.77% as in Ranchi during 1977-91.\nCanal\nIX.7 Canal irrigation showed an increasing trend only in respect of the east plains (2.12%) and the south-west plains (1.35\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India with significant agricultural activity and irrigation potential, facing challenges in fully utilizing its irrigation capabilities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUNJAB<|>GEO<|>State in India with a high percentage of net irrigated area compared to Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARYANA<|>GEO<|>State in India with a high percentage of net irrigated area compared to Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UTTAR PRADESH<|>GEO<|>State in India with a higher percentage of net irrigated area than Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PATNA<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with an irrigated area at 60.94%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEGUSARAI<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with relatively high levels of irrigation, at 70.55%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROHTAS<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar showing a high rate of increase in irrigation at 2.32% per annum)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAWADAH<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with a declining trend in net irrigated area)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAYA<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with a declining trend in net irrigated area)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIWAN<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with relatively high levels of irrigation, at 70.37%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SARAN<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with relatively high levels of irrigation, at 68.68%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PURNIA<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with one of the least coverage of irrigation, at 23.87%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KATIHAR<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with one of the least coverage of irrigation, at 29.54%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MADHUBANI<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with one of the least coverage of irrigation, at 21.15%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SITAMARHI<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with one of the least coverage of irrigation, at 23.69%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VAISHALI<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar showing impressive growth in irrigated area, at 5.75%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DARBHANGA<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar showing impressive growth in irrigated area, at 5.96%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PALAMU<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with a relatively high level of irrigation at 21.75% among plateau districts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DHANBAD<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar showing shrinkage in the level of irrigation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RANCHI<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar showing shrinkage in the level of irrigation)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>PUNJAB<|>Bihar has a lower percentage of net irrigated area compared to Punjab<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>HARYANA<|>Bihar has a lower percentage of net irrigated area compared to Haryana<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>UTTAR PRADESH<|>Bihar has a lower percentage of net irrigated area compared to Uttar Pradesh<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PATNA<|>BIHAR<|>Patna is a district in Bihar with specific irrigation statistics<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BEGUSARAI<|>BIHAR<|>Begusarai is a district in Bihar with high levels of irrigation<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROHTAS<|>BIHAR<|>Rohtas is a district in Bihar showing significant increase in irrigation<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NAWADAH<|>BIHAR<|>Nawadah is a district in Bihar with a declining trend in irrigation<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GAYA<|>BIHAR<|>Gaya is a district in Bihar with a declining trend in irrigation<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
