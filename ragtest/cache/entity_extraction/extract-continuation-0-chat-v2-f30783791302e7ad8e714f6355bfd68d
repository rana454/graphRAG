The staples also account for nearly 70 percent of the total food grain production in the state. Such a rice–wheat cropping system is the result of underlying agroclimatic and topographical factors in Bihar.\nNorth Bihar: The Ganges demarcates the state into two halves: North Bihar, which is more densely populated, predominantly agrarian, and flood-prone.\nSouth Bihar: South Bihar reflects a mix of agricultural and industrial activities and is largely drought-prone.\nNorth Bihar consists of two agroclimatic zones:\nNorthwest Alluvial Plain (Zone I)\nNortheast Alluvial Plain (Zone II)\nBoth of these zones receive more rainfall relative to the agroclimatic zone of the South Bihar alluvial plain. The differences in rainfall, temperature, and soil underlying these different agroclimatic zones are important determinants of land use patterns within the state and associated cropping systems that, in turn, influence food and nutrition security, as well as environmental sustainability. (Details are in the Appendix.)\n\nAgricultural Output by Agroclimatic Zones\nRice Production:\nNearly half of the state’s total rice output is cultivated in the southwest agroclimatic zone in Bihar.\nAnother 25 percent of output originates in the northwest zone.\nThe northeast and southeast zones account for one-fifth of rice production.\nThe northeast zone accounts for the smallest share of rice output, at 12 percent.\nWheat Production:\nEach agroclimatic zone’s share of wheat production is nearly identical to its share of area under wheat cultivation.\nProduction is centered primarily in the northwest zone.\nMaize Production:\nCultivation of maize is concentrated in the northeast agroclimatic zone.\nIt accounts for nearly two-thirds of the total maize output, spread over nearly half of the area used for maize cultivation in Bihar.\nThere are variations in output and productivity across different types of crops. The increase in cereal production has largely stemmed from an increase in output and productivity of wheat and maize (for maize, these increases are predominantly in the rabi season), while output and productivity of rice has decreased in each of the three cultivating seasons. It will be interesting to examine further if the reduction of rice is being replaced by the increased production of wheat.\nPulses Production:\nPulses have not seen significant yield improvements over the period 2014–19.\nImplications for Nutrition Security and Environmental Sustainability\nThe cereal-centric, smallholder farmer-driven agriculture in Bihar has implications for both nutrition security (SDG2) and environmental sustainability (SDG12, SDG13). Agroclimatic variations within Bihar will eventually determine the growth of incomes and yields in the agricultural sector. The potential for increasing farmer incomes by improvements in yields and diversification of the cropping system is presented in the next chapter.\n\nDoubling Incomes While Reducing Risks\nDoubling the incomes of smallholder farming households is a key area of focus, both for SDG2 and for the Indian government. SDG2.3 calls for doubling the incomes of small-scale farmers by 2030, placing particular importance on smallholders. In the case of crop agriculture, income growth could come from increasing yields, intensification of cultivation—growing two or three crops per year on the same piece of land—or increasing the efficiency of input use, thereby raising total factor productivity. Presumably, all these strategies would lead to an increase in farm incomes. Income growth-oriented strategies should also include production system diversification for crops and livestock, improved market access, and enhancement of rural nonfarm employment opportunities.\nIn this chapter, we focus on incomes from crop production and animal farming. For agricultural households in Bihar, as throughout India, these two areas account for nearly 60 percent of the average monthly income of agricultural households. Data from 2012–13 suggest that agricultural income in Bihar is almost half of the national average. The average monthly income from agricultural activities was INR 1,994 for Bihar in the year 2012–13, whereas it was INR 3,844, on average, throughout India.\n\nCrop Cultivation and Income\nCrop cultivation is the main source of income for small and marginal agricultural households in Bihar, accounting for nearly half of the average monthly income of agricultural households (2012–13). Conversely, small farmers reported negative returns from animal rearing, demonstrating a need for more support for the activity (Figure 5.1).\n5.1 Increasing Productivity of Staple Cereals\nAn improvement in crop yields can act as a catalyst for improving nutritional outcomes through the income pathway, wherein higher yields can allow farmers to earn higher incomes from the production of a greater marketable surplus. In this respect, Bihar’s Third Agricultural Roadmap (2017–22) aims to create an environment geared toward profitability and sustainability of farming, while ensuring food and nutritional security.\nImpact of the Green Revolution\nThe Green Revolution (GR) significantly increased the productivity of the rice–wheat cropping system. Much of these gains, however, were concentrated in the Western Indo-Gangetic Plain (WIGP), in states like Punjab and Haryana. In contrast, gains from the GR were low in the Eastern Indo-Gangetic Plain (EIGP), a region that is characterized by high population density, smallholder farming, poor market infrastructure, low access to new technologies, and climatic variations.\nWhile there has been a steady increase in rice yields in the state, they are lower than yields found in the rest of the country, particularly in the WIGP. Wheat is the main rabi crop in Bihar, and productivity levels have increased in the last five years. However, the levels remain below average for India and the WIGP.\nYield Disparities and Contributing Factors\nViewed from the district level, the differences in cereal yields between the Western and Eastern IGP appear more nuanced.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India characterized by its distinct agroclimatic zones, which influence its agricultural patterns and food production, including rice, wheat, and maize)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORTH BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A densely populated, predominantly agrarian region of Bihar that is prone to flooding)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTH BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A region in Bihar with a mix of agricultural and industrial activities, largely drought-prone)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORTHWEST ALLUVIAL PLAIN<|>GEO<|>An agroclimatic zone in North Bihar receiving more rainfall and contributing significantly to the state's wheat production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORTHEAST ALLUVIAL PLAIN<|>GEO<|>An agroclimatic zone in North Bihar known for its maize production and significant rainfall)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTH BIHAR ALLUVIAL PLAIN<|>GEO<|>An agroclimatic zone in South Bihar with different rainfall, temperature, and soil characteristics influencing its cropping systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREEN REVOLUTION<|>EVENT<|>A period marked by increased productivity in the rice–wheat cropping system, with significant gains in the Western Indo-Gangetic Plain but lower impacts in Bihar)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NORTH BIHAR<|>BIHAR<|>North Bihar is a region within the state of Bihar, characterized by its flooding-prone nature and agrarian economy<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOUTH BIHAR<|>BIHAR<|>South Bihar is a region within the state of Bihar, known for its drought-prone conditions and mix of agriculture and industry<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NORTHWEST ALLUVIAL PLAIN<|>NORTH BIHAR<|>The Northwest Alluvial Plain is one of the agroclimatic zones within North Bihar<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NORTHEAST ALLUVIAL PLAIN<|>NORTH BIHAR<|>The Northeast Alluvial Plain is one of the agroclimatic zones within North Bihar, contributing to its maize production<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOUTH BIHAR ALLUVIAL PLAIN<|>SOUTH BIHAR<|>The South Bihar Alluvial Plain is an agroclimatic zone within South Bihar, influencing its land use and cropping systems<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GREEN REVOLUTION<|>BIHAR<|>The Green Revolution had a significant impact on agriculture in Bihar, particularly in increasing the productivity of the rice–wheat cropping system, though less than in other regions<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
