It was more sharp at (-2.09%) per annum during the first sub-period. The declining trend narrowed in the second sub-period at (-1.05%) per annum, due to wider application of HYV seeds/pesticides technology in particular. Bihar occupied sixth position in its production (135.7 thousand tonnes in 1990-93) with states such as Madhya Pradesh (1778.13 thousand tonnes), Uttar Pradesh (994.77 thousand tonnes), and Rajasthan (827.90 thousand tonnes) way ahead of Bihar. Declining trends in the production of gram were the general pattern across major gram growing states, except Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh. In these states, it showed an increasing trend ranging between 6.18% and 1.18% during 1983-93. Among the major gram growing states, the rate of decline was relatively high in Haryana (-1.28%), Uttar Pradesh (-2.24%), and Rajasthan (-3.17%) during the same period.\nIV.5.2 Regional Pattern\nAcross different zones, the south-west plains alone produced three-fifths (61.09%) of gram in the State. The share of other zones was much less at 18.76% for the east plains, 11.07% for the plateau districts, and 9.08% for the north-west plains. Among the districts, Patna (14.77%), Bhojpur (14.21%), and Rohtas (13.37%) were the major gram growing centers in the State, producing two-fifths of the State gram production. Other districts with relatively high shares of gram production included:\nPlateau: Palamu (5.02%)\nSouth-West Plains: Nalanda (6.28%) and Gaya (6.03%)\nEast: Munger (9.59%) and Bhagalpur (5.37%)\nNorth-West Plains: Darbhanga (2.27%) and Siwan (1.70%)\nIV.5.3 Trend Growth Rates\nAnalysis of trend growth rates in the production of gram for the period 1977-91 revealed that the south-west alluvial plains had an increasing trend in gram production (2.03%) during 1977-91. In other zones, viz. north-west alluvial plains, east alluvial plains, and plateau regions, it showed a declining trend at (-2.26%), (-1.08%), and (-0.90%), respectively. The declining trend became sharp in respect of the north-west alluvial plains from (-0.10%) in the first sub-period to (-4.21%) in the second sub-period. Declining trend continued to be sharp at (-2.96%) during the second sub-period as against (-2.82%) during the first sub-period in respect of the east plains. In the case of the south-west plains, it reversed to a declining trend at (-0.56%) in the second sub-period from an increasing trend at 0.49% during the first sub-period. The growth rate further decelerated from (-0.90%) in the first sub-period to (-2.12%) in the second sub-period in the plateau zone. Across different districts, the rate of growth in gram production was relatively high in:\nDarbhanga (2.69%)\nAurangabad (4.39%)\nNawadah (4.59%)\nMajor gram growing districts such as Palamu, Santhal Parganas, and Rohtas showed a reversal in the growth rate of gram output.\nIV.5.4 Instability Analysis\nThe production of gram in the State was observed to decline with a coefficient of variation at 9.87% only. Across different zones, the south-west plains alone showed a stable increase in gram production with a coefficient of variation at 12.95% only. However, in respect of the plateau districts, the declining trend in gram production showed high fluctuation, as the coefficient of variation was high at 25.99%. On the other hand, the declining trend in respect of the north-west and the east plains was more stable with a coefficient of variation at 15.66% and 12.55%, respectively. Across major gram growing districts, the increasing trend was more stable in Patna with a coefficient of variation at 13.96% only. But it was relatively more unstable in the case of Bhojpur (24.17%) and Rohtas (20.59%). In Palamu and Darbhanga, the rate of increase was not stable, as the coefficient of variation was high at 42.40% and 37.24%, respectively. Bhagalpur too was a major gram growing district. In its case, however, the production of gram showed a declining trend (-1.19%) with low fluctuation, as the coefficient of variation was 12.80% only.\nIV.5.5 Analysis of Acceleration/Deceleration\nThe declining trend in gram production of the State was observed to be decelerating (-0.06%). The increasing trend in the south-west plains was found to decelerate (-0.03%). The declining trend in respect of the north-west (-0.22%), east plains (-0.08%), and plateau districts (-0.05%) was also decelerating. Among the major gram growing districts, the increasing trend was found to be accelerating only in:\nPatna (0.65%)\nPalamu (0.92%)\nDarbhanga (0.51%)\nIn the case of Bhojpur (-0.23%) and Rohtas (-0.25%), the increasing trend was observed to be decelerating.
