In Bihar, the share of PACS in total credit flow was 28.30%, compared to higher shares in Kerala (68.31%), Punjab (59.72%), and the all-India level (42.48%). The share of production credit was also disproportionately low in Bihar at 36.50% compared to higher percentages in other states.\nXI.4 Regional Disparity in Credit Flow\ni) Zone-wise Analysis:\nCredit flow was highest in the agriculturally developed south-west plains (29.86%) and the north-west plains (24.79%). The plateau districts received relatively less credit (22.91%). High credit flow was observed in Ranchi (7.03%), Santhal Parganas (4.64%), and East Singhbhum (4.75%) of the plateau zone; Gaya (5.60%), Nalanda (5.22%), Patna (5.23%), and Rohtas (5.25%) of the south-west plains; Begusarai (5.79%) and Purnea (4.83%) of the east plains; and West Champaran (3.82%), East Champaran (3.02%), and Muzaffarpur (3.52%) of the north-west plains. Districts with relatively low credit flow included Hazaribagh (0.92%) and Giridih (1.19%) of the plateau zone; and Vaishali (1.21%), Madhubani (1.42%), and Gopalganj (1.33%) of the north-west plains.\nii) Credit Flow per Hectare:\nThe south-west plains had the highest credit flow per hectare (Rs. 340.2). The plateau districts showed a per hectare credit flow of Rs. 303.8, surpassing the north-west (Rs. 218.1) and east plains (Rs. 248.8). High credit flow per hectare was noted in Dhanbad (Rs. 921.0) of the plateau zone; Nalanda (Rs. 546.8) and Patna (Rs. 519.2) of the south-west plains; and Begusarai (Rs. 521.4) of the east plains. Lower credit flow per hectare was seen in Gopalganj (Rs. 132.6), Madhubani (Rs. 129.3), Sitamarhi (Rs. 178.3), Vaishali (Rs. 177.5), Saharsa (Rs. 165.9), Purnea (Rs. 182.4), and Bhagalpur (Rs. 189.9). Hazaribagh of the plateau zone had a low level of credit flow per hectare (Rs. 124.5).\niii) Credit Share in Agriculture:\nThe plateau zone had a relatively high level of credit flow per hectare due to a higher share of credit to non-agricultural sectors, with agriculture accounting for only 55.21% of the total credit flow. In contrast, other zones had a higher share of credit to agriculture, ranging from 68.0% to 73.0%. High shares of credit to agriculture were noted in districts such as West Champaran (86.28%), East Champaran (78.23%) of the north-west plains; Begusarai (87.09%), Katihar (75.47%), and Purnea (76.86%) of the east plains; Nawadah (89.57%), Nalanda (85.88%), and Aurangabad (85.62%) of the south-west plains; and Santhal Parganas (79.28%) of the plateau zone.\nXI.5 Recovery Performance\ni) Overdues and Recovery Rates:\nHigh overdues of institutional credit have been a significant issue in Bihar. The recovery performance of PACS was 42.95% in 1985-86, improved to 55.62% in 1988-89, but dropped to 1.65% in 1989-90. Recovery rates remained low in subsequent years.\nThe recovery performance of SLDB was 85.25% in 1986-87 but fell sharply to 17.38% in 1987-88 and 19.42% in 1988-89. Recovery performance increased to 53.81% in 1990-91 due to loan waiver schemes but declined again to 16.22% in 1992-93.\nCommercial banks showed relatively better recovery performance, with rates ranging from 33.85% in 1992-93 to 59.76% in 1991-92 during the period from 1985-86 to 1992-93.\n\nConclusions\nXI.13 Broad Conclusions on Institutional Credit Flow in Bihar\ni) Credit Gap: The gap between estimated credit requirements (as per the Sen Committee/Task Force/Potential Linked Plan) and actual credit flow has been significant, with not even half of the estimated requirements being met. This gap is widening due to a downward trend in credit flow.\nii) Comparison with Other States: The flow of credit in Bihar has been disappointing compared to other major states. For example, it was Rs. 5,961 per hectare in Kerala, Rs. 2,155 in Tamil Nadu, and Rs. 1,189 in Punjab, compared to Rs. 312 in Bihar in 1991-92.\niii) Share of Agriculture: The share of agriculture in total credit flow was high but fluctuated significantly from year to year.\niv) Decline in Co-operative Credit: Co-operative credit has been declining, with its share in total credit flow being almost negligible in recent years.\nv) Commercial Banks' Role: Commercial banks have\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
