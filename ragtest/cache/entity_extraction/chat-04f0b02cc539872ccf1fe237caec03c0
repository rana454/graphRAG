Along with this, there are many opportunities for the state agriculture. The Fourth Agriculture Road Map has been prepared to address the challenges before agriculture.\nObjectives\nIn formulating this road map, it has been kept in mind that there should be development of a multitude of marginal farmers of the state. Special attention has been paid to address the needs of women farmers. This road map promotes investment in the public sector on a priority basis, along with creating a conducive environment to encourage private investment in the state. The Fourth Agriculture Road Map also aims at convergence between various departments, with the public and private sectors working together for the farmers.\nThe specialty of the Fourth Agriculture Road Map is that, along with the detailed vision of this road map, approval has been granted for the DPRs (Detailed Project Reports) of priority sectors. As a result, continuous work of these schemes will be possible for five years to achieve the target. The Fourth Agriculture Road Map is dedicated to working for the interests of raiyat as well as non-raiyat farmers, keeping the same definition of farmers as in the first three agricultural road maps.\nKey Objectives\n1. Food and Nutrition Security\n2. Promotion of Non-Raiyat and Women Farmers: Along with raiyat farmers, for inclusive development.\n3. Sustainable Development\n4. Convergence Between Departments: Mutual coordination between government departments and the private sector in relation to farmer-related subjects.\n5. Formation of Farmers’ Groups: For the purpose of small farmer-big farming.\n6. Use of Modern Technology: To improve farmers' lives by solving their problems.\n7. Damage Reduction: Specific measures to reduce damage to agricultural produce during production and after production.\n8. Development of Specific Agricultural Areas: Special program for areas such as Tal, Diara, and Chaur.\n9. Integrated Development: Development of horticulture, animal husbandry, fisheries sector, along with crops.\n10. Climate Change Preparedness: Preparing farmers for climate change situations and maintaining ecological balance.\nPreparation Process\nThe Fourth Agriculture Road Map has been prepared after\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
