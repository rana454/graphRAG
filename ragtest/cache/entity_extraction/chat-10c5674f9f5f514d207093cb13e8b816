A large number of farmers in Bihar are isolated from institutional credit sources. Even if some sources are available, the amount is inadequate and availability is not timely. This constrains farmers' adoption of technological practices.\nSmall & Fragmented Holdings\nLand holdings in Bihar are predominantly marginal farms with a high level of fragmentation. Of all the holdings, more than 90 percent are small and marginal farmers. Tiny and fragmented holdings play a deterrent to the adoption of modern technology. This affects the economy of scale as well as the adoption of improved farm practices.\nDiesel-Based Irrigation which Increases the Cost of Production\nIrrigation is mostly dependent on diesel-operated tube wells. The high operational cost of diesel engine pump sets forces the farmers to practice deficit irrigation of cereal crops. As a result, the yields of all crops are much lower than their potential yields.\nLack of Effective System for Transfer of Technology\nThe extension system as it exists now is very weak both structurally and in its capacity to absorb and disseminate modern technology. Since independence, many extension systems have been tried but most of them have been unsustainable over the long run. A rationalization of the system is therefore required. Another major lacuna has been the inadequacy of research-supported extension systems. The Agriculture University in Bihar has failed to develop and promote research which could support farm extension services.\nRisk Arising out of Flood & Drought\nAgriculture in the State is prone to natural calamities. Whereas the North Bihar districts are affected by recurrent floods, the South Bihar districts are prone to lack of rainfall. Almost 41 percent of the geographical area of the State is flood-prone. On the other hand, 40 percent of the geographical area of South Bihar is drought-prone. This affects improved and modern farm practices and accelerated technology adoption leading to lower levels of farm productivity and farmers' income.\nRural Power Supply\nPower generation and availability rates are the lowest in Bihar in the country. Compared to an all-India average annual electricity consumption level of 334 kWh and 895 kWh of Punjab, the average per capita consumption of electricity in Bihar was only 55 kWh. All efforts are being made to help improve the power supply to rural Bihar.\nLand Records, Tenancy, and Reforms\nThe entire process of tenancy reforms in Bihar has been derailed, with consequent impacts on agricultural stagnation and farmers’ misery in terms of acute poverty. The process of obtaining records of ownership rights of land is cumbersome and is reported to involve very high transaction costs. Unrecorded oral tenancy is prevalent with very weak tenant security. Tenancy in Bihar overwhelmingly consists of leasing-in by small and marginal farmers. The computerization of land records, protection of tenancy, and fixation of rent are of prime importance for the development of the agriculture sector in Bihar. Attention is now being paid towards these deficiencies.\nRural Infrastructure\nBihar’s agricultural stagnation has been caused by poor rural infrastructure connectivity. The total surface length of roads per lakh of population is only 43.89 km as opposed to the national average of 151.27 km (1999-2000). Although 32 percent of the villages in the State are connected by roads, due to lack of maintenance, it is reported that most of the village roads provide only seasonal connectivity. This has been a matter of prime concern to the present government, and attempts are being made to bring drastic improvements in rural infrastructure.\nLack of Procurement\nRice and wheat procurement has largely been limited to a few states of the country. Public procurement in Bihar has remained very low over the decade, having implications for farmers’ misery. The farmers of Bihar have to resort to distress sale in a season of plenty. Farmers are deprived of a remunerative price for their produce. Therefore, the farmers of the State need to be assured to get a minimum assured price. Adequate procurement centers need to be opened. Also, it is imperative that the procurement of maize is made operative, as maize production has gained high momentum. Several districts of Bihar have shown the best performance in increased maize production in recent years.\nInadequate Storage\nThere is a major inadequacy in storage facilities in Bihar. It is assessed that there is a need for 25 lakh MT storage capacity, whereas the created capacity is only 12 lakh MT. Besides, there is a need for creating proper storage infrastructure at the primary level. Lack of storage capacity leads to huge losses (sometimes to the extent of 50%) leading to erosion in farm income.\nInadequate Processing & Marketing\nClimatological and edaphic factors allow for the cultivation of a variety of crops in Bihar. However, farmers get discouraged as they do not get adequate prices for their produce. It is a common understanding that the comparative advantage in production is lost because of inadequate marketing and processing facilities. In Maharashtra, 40% of the produce is used for processing, whereas it is less than 2% in Bihar. This is due to poor marketing infrastructure in the State.\n\nINTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL RISK MANAGEMENT\nNeed for Integrated Risk Management in Agriculture\nAgriculture is the single largest private sector occupation in Bihar and can be considered the riskiest business. The vulnerability to income and consumption shocks makes it imperative to develop formal agricultural insurance mechanisms to cope with such risks. The traditional yield insurance schemes have failed in managing the risks of poor farmers as evident from their historically high payouts and poor penetration rates. Such schemes like the erstwhile Comprehensive Crop Insurance Scheme (CCIS) which finally took the form of the present National Agricultural Insurance Scheme (NAIS) suffer from several deficiencies.\nThe ‘area approach’ followed is based on the results of crop-cutting experiments where the insured farmer receives indemnity based upon the difference between the threshold yield and the yield of the crop-cut\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
