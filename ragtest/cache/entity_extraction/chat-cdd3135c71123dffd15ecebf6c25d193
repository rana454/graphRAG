The majority of beekeepers have increased their number of hives and productivity.\nIncome and Assets:\n80% of households reported increased income from beekeeping, with substantial growth in many cases.\nMany households have improved their assets, including both productive and non-productive assets, using honey income.\nChallenges:\nSome beekeepers faced losses due to floods, diseases, or financial constraints.\nWomen are significantly involved in managing bee colonies and honey extraction but are not engaged in external activities like marketing or hive migration.\nBanking and Credit:\nAccess to bank loans has been somewhat limited, with many beekeepers still relying on moneylenders for seasonal costs or large expenses.\nExternal Factors:\nImprovements in governance and infrastructure have positively impacted beekeeping.\nClimate extremes and access to inputs also influence the sector's dynamics.\nLivelihood Resilience/Security:\nThere has been an overall improvement in household status and asset ownership, with many beekeepers experiencing better healthcare and education for their children.\nEmployment in Beekeeping\nHired Employment:\nThe number of employed workers in beekeeping has increased, with many beekeepers employing full-time or seasonal workers.\nPayments to workers are generally in line with or slightly above local market conditions.\nBenchmarking Poverty\nProgress Out of Poverty Index (PPI):\nBeekeeper households showed a reduction in poverty rates from 2002 to 2008, contrasting with an increase in poverty among non-beekeepers during the same period.\n\nPoverty Benchmarking (Table 5)\n% Below Poverty Line\n2002\nRural Bihar: 37%\nBeekeepers: 25%\nNon-beekeepers: 22%\n2006\nRural Bihar: 28%\nBeekeepers: 19%\nNon-beekeepers: 29%\n2008\nRural Bihar: 28%\nBeekeepers: 31%\nNon-beekeepers: 44%\nKey Points:\nBeekeepers showed significant improvement in their economic conditions compared to non-beekeepers.\nBeekeeping helped lift many out of poverty, as indicated by the lower percentage below the poverty line compared to non-beekeepers.\nLinked Enterprises\n9.1 Upstream Enterprises\nBee Hive Makers:\nIncreased from an unspecified number to 12 units due to the VC initiative.\nEach unit employs 4-6 workers.\nAverage wages: Rs100-200 per day.\nProduction and Revenue (Table 6)\n2002 to 2008: Significant increase in production and net revenue for bee hive makers.\nUnit One: Production up from 194 to 1,818 hives, net income up by 468%.\nUnit Two: Production up from 125 to 550 hives, net income up by 367%.\n9.2 Midstream Enterprises\nHoney Marketing Agents:\nAjay Kumar increased honey sales from 80 tonnes in 2003-04 to 600 tonnes in 2007-08.\nAnnual turnover from honey trade: Approx.
