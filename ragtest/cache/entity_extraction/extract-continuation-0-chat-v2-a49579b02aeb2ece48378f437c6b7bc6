The state is located on an elevation of 300 to 610 msl and the climate ranges from dry semi-humid to humid semi-arid types. Jharkhand is largely comprised of the forest tracks of Chhotonagpur plateau and SanthalPargana with a total forest area of 23.32 lakh ha which covers 29.26 percent of the geographical area of the state and much above the national average of about 18 percent.\nThe state has 24 districts, 212 blocks, and 32,260 revenue villages to house a population size of 32,988,134 (census 2011). Distribution of population in rural and urban areas indicates that 25,055,073 persons live in rural areas and the rest 7,933,061 in urban areas. Of the total population, 70 percent depends mainly on agriculture and allied activities for their livelihood, contributing about 15 percent to the Gross Domestic Product.\nThe state of Jharkhand comes under Agro-climatic Zone VII i.e. Eastern Plateau and Hill Region. This region is further divided into three zones namely, Central and North Eastern Plateau, Western Plateau, and South Eastern Plateau zone. The state falls in zone 12 and 13 as per agro-ecological characterization of the country. Central North Eastern Zone has the highest total geographical area (4.1 m ha), net cultivated area (55%), and least forest area (13%) whereas South Eastern Plateau has minimum total geographical area (1.3 m ha), 31.6 percent of net cultivated area, and 24.0 percent forest area. The highest forest area is available in Western Plateau (33%) followed by 2.5 m ha total geographical area and 24 percent net cultivated area.\nOut of the total 79.71 lakh ha of total geographical area, total cultivable land is 38.0 lakh ha but the net sown area is 25.75 lakh ha. Current fallow and other fallow constitute 8.87 and 6.75 lakh ha, respectively whereas 5.74 lakh ha land is barren in nature. Land put under non-agricultural use is 6.87 lakh ha and cultivable waste land accounts for 2.74 ha. Irrigated land area is 3.007 lakh ha and the cropping intensity is 116 percent. Annual precipitation in the plateau and sub-plateau region is 1400 mm on average, of which nearly 83 percent is received during June to September and the rest in remaining months. A number of perennial rivers and streams flow through the state and the important rivers are Damodar, Subarnarekha, KoelKaro, Barakar, and Sankh. Natural forest and mineral reserves are the most important resources of this state. It ranks first in the production of coal, mica, kyanite, and copper in the country.\nGranite gneiss and granite schists are the major constituents of developing soil in this region accounting for 32.6 and 14.2 percent, respectively. Soil salinity on flooding is an unknown problem in this region. However, the problem of soil acidity (pH< 5.5) is quite acute which affects 4 lakh hectares of cultivated area. Sheet and gully erosion are the major causes behind the loss of soil and plant nutrients as the land surface is uneven and undulating. This has resulted in severe erosion every year to the extent of 23 lakh hectares of land.\nFood security situation in the state of Jharkhand is very precarious. In spite of being bestowed with huge natural resources, 40 percent of the population of the state live below the poverty line. World Food Programme mapping has listed the state as one of the lowest in the ladder of development indicators. According to National Survey II, about 2 percent of the population suffers from acute and chronic hunger and 10 percent from seasonal food insecurity. Nearly 70 percent of the population depends on small farmland less than 1 hectare size. Hence, stabilizing agriculture for small and marginal farmers along with looking for livelihood options in the state is one of the greatest challenges which should be addressed with utmost seriousness and sincerity.\nYear-wise Growth of KVK in Jharkhand\nThere are 23 KVKs in the State of Jharkhand of which 16 are operating under the control of BAU, Ranchi and 7 belonging to different NGOs, ICAR Institute, and District Administration. Four KVKs, namely, Ranchi, Hazaribag, Deoghar, and West Singhbhum, are working in the State since a long time. However, the remaining 19 KVKs are relatively new. The year-wise growth of KVKs in Jharkhand is presented graphically.\nThe KVKs, through their mandated activities namely, technology assessment, technology refinement, demonstrations, trainings, and extension activities as well as production of critical inputs like seeds, planting materials, etc., have played a very significant role in agricultural development in respective district technology-wise details are as follows:\nIn the State of Jharkhand, as a whole, 2,263 numbers of training programmes were offered to 59,801 beneficiaries during 2012-13. Farmers and farm-women trained were 44,623 covering 1,589 courses. Rural youth trained were 8,604 during the period covering 410 number of courses. While extension functionaries were trained through 264 number of courses involving 6,574 beneficiaries.\nCaste-wise participation in the training programmes shows that in Jh\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JHARKHAND<|>GEO<|>A state in India surrounded by Bihar, West Bengal, Odisha, and Chattisgarh, known for its significant forest area and dependence on agriculture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>State in India located to the north of Jharkhand)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEST BENGAL<|>GEO<|>State in India located to the east of Jharkhand)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ODISHA<|>GEO<|>State in India located to the south of Jharkhand)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHATTISGARH<|>GEO<|>State in India located to the west of Jharkhand)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHHOTONAGPUR PLATEAU<|>GEO<|>A major part of Jharkhand, known for its extensive forest tracks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SANTHALPARGANA<|>GEO<|>A region in Jharkhand, part of the forest tracks along with Chhotonagpur plateau)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAMODAR<|>GEO<|>One of the major rivers flowing through Jharkhand)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUBARNAREKHA<|>GEO<|>A significant river in Jharkhand)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOELKARO<|>GEO<|>A river in Jharkhand)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BARAKAR<|>GEO<|>One of Jharkhand's important rivers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SANKH<|>GEO<|>A major river in Jharkhand)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAU, RANCHI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An organization controlling 16 KVKs in Jharkhand)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KVK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Krishi Vigyan Kendras, agricultural extension centers in Jharkhand aimed at agricultural development)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JHARKHAND<|>BIHAR<|>Jharkhand is bordered by Bihar to the north<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JHARKHAND<|>WEST BENGAL<|>Jharkhand is bordered by West Bengal to the east<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JHARKHAND<|>ODISHA<|>Jharkhand is bordered by Odisha to the south<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JHARKHAND<|>CHATTISGARH<|>Jharkhand is bordered by Chattisgarh to the west<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JHARKHAND<|>CHHOTONAGPUR PLATEAU<|>The Chhotonagpur plateau is a significant part of Jharkhand's geography<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JHARKHAND<|>SANTHALPARGANA<|>SanthalPargana is a region within Jharkhand<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JHARKHAND<|>DAMODAR<|>The Damodar river flows through Jharkhand<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JHARKHAND<|>SUBARNAREKHA<|>The Subarnarekha river is a significant water body in Jharkhand<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JHARKHAND<|>KOELKARO<|>The KoelKaro river flows within Jharkhand<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JHARKHAND<|>BARAKAR<|>The Barakar river is one of Jharkhand's important rivers<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JHARKHAND<|>SANKH<|>The Sankh river is a major river in Jharkhand<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BAU, RANCHI<|>KVK<|>BAU, Ranchi controls 16 KVKs in Jharkhand<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
