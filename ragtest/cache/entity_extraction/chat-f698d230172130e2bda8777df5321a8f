The traditional yield insurance schemes have failed in managing the risks of poor farmers as evident from their historically high payouts and poor penetration rates. Such schemes like the erstwhile Comprehensive Crop Insurance Scheme (CCIS) which finally took the form of the present National Agricultural Insurance Scheme (NAIS) suffer from several deficiencies.\nThe ‘area approach’ followed is based on the results of crop-cutting experiments where the insured farmer receives indemnity based upon the difference between the threshold yield and the yield of the crop-cutting experiments in their area. Since crop yields vary over a small area, situations exist in which farmers do not get compensated for their loss under the NAIS and farmers without insurable losses would receive payments.\nCrop insurance is mandatory for farmers who take crop loans, which dampens innovation. Farmers with adequate risk management capabilities should not be forced to purchase crop insurance in order to receive a loan. Problems are faced especially when the loan is paid up and there is a lack of understanding of the benefits of agricultural insurance which leads to a fall in the demand for insurance.\nThere are long delays in payment of claims to farmers due to the time-consuming crop-cutting experiments by the agriculture department which causes an erosion of income for farmers.\nPhysical verification of the losses proved to be very costly and often gave way to fraud as it allows for an opportunity for collusion between the assessor and the client. Hence, moral hazard and adverse selection are inherent in the design. (Annexure XXXV and XXXVI show the performance of the NAIS in Bihar compared to other Indian states and an overview of its cumulative performance).\nThe Agricultural Insurance Company of India Ltd’s Varsha Bima and Weather-Based Crop Insurance Scheme (WBCIS) aim at overcoming the problems with NAIS or the Rashtriya Krishi Bima Yojana (RKBY) which is mandatory for the loanee farmers. It is voluntary for the non-loanee farmers and reaching out to the non-loanee farmers is a larger challenge, beyond the immediate need for product and process innovations.\nIn view of these deficiencies and the unsustainable role of the State in subsidizing crop insurance which could crowd out the role of the private sector, index-based weather insurance models could be a more efficient means to deal with risks faced in agriculture.\nNearly 60% of the area under cultivation in Bihar is rain-fed. The co-efficient of variation in annual rainfall during 1980-81 to 2002-03 was 32 percent. The monsoons play a critical role in the sub-continent as it determines whether the harvest will be bountiful, average, or poor in a given year. About 49 percent of the state’s total cropped area is irrigated, as against the national average of 40 percent. Nearly 76 percent of the net irrigated area in Zone-1, 85 percent of the net irrigated area in Zone-2, and 45 percent of the net irrigated area in Zone-3 have tube wells as the source, while canal irrigation accounts for about 14 percent in Zone-1, 13 percent in Zone-2, and 48 percent in Zone-3. Farmers could purchase rainfall contracts and if the rainfall in an area varies from a pre-defined level, varying levels of payment would be compensated to the respective farmers based upon the level of shortfall of rainfall. This alternate approach compared to the NAIS would be effective in reducing moral hazard and transaction costs. Innovations in the form of index-based weather insurance have come up in the past few years to explore possibilities of overcoming some of the deficiencies and are being improved on the basis of the feedback from product pilots.\nThe three main agro-climatic zones on the basis of soil characterization, rainfall, temperature, and terrain—North West Alluvial Plains (Zone – I), North East Alluvial Plains (Zone – II), South Bihar Alluvial Plains (Zone – III)—have different average precipitation levels and the variations in weather phenomena are wide enough to substantiate the need for relevant interventions in the space of agri-risk management across the three zones.\nManaging Production Risks and Price Risks\nGiven the status of agricultural risk management in the state, there is a need to focus on the critical areas of price risk and production risk management.\nProduction risks refer to the high variability of production outcomes due to the unpredictable nature of the weather, seasonal fluctuations, and pest infestation, diseases which result in yield loss and revenue loss for the farmer. Insurance can play a pivotal role in covering production risks which would help reduce the vulnerability of the farmers to economic losses. Developing appropriate products based on the needs of a particular geography to manage risks associated with agricultural production is the need of the hour.\nPrice Risk in Agriculture\nPrice risk refers to the input and output price volatility to which producers are exposed, as the markets for inputs and outputs in the agricultural sector are subject to instability. The fluctuations in price are largely owed to the seasonal fluctuations in demand, lack of information about market prices, lack of alternative market avenues, inability to hold tradable surpluses until the producer attains a better price, national policy level changes, and volatility in the global market. This volatility in price places producers in a precarious situation as they witness unforeseen losses due to falls in output prices or are faced with increased costs of cultivation due to higher input prices.\nVulnerable Groups\nThe large vulnerable groups like landless labourers and sharecroppers face a variety of risks which have a bearing on their steady flow of income and their ability to build income-generating assets. The main risks identified for the population dependent on agriculture are:\nPrice risks\nProduction risks\nInstitutional risks\nPersonal risks\nEnterprise risk\nBusiness risks\nBihar is not an exception, and these risks become ever more prominent given the importance of agriculture in the state and the gross linkages to livelihoods and industries.\nPrice Fluctuations\nPrices of agricultural commodities fluct\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
