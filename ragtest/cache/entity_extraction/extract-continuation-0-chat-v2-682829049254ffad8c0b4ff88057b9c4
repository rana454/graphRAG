As regards piggery, there is no pig breeding farm or bacon factory in the Government sector. (Annexure XVI)\nGoat and Sheep Breeding\nAs regards Goat, Beetal breed goat farm and sheep breeding farm at Chatra, Black Bengal goat farm at Thaithaitanger, Bolba (Gumla) are now in Jharkhand state and no sheep and goat breeding farm is available in reorganized Bihar state.\nFisheries and Aquaculture\nCurrent State of Fisheries and Aquaculture\nBihar is blessed with vast and varied fisheries and aquaculture resources. These resources are in the form of rivers, reservoirs, lakes, mauns, chaurs, irrigation canals, ponds, and community tanks. However, despite such natural resources and fish being a highly preferred food item, aquaculture and open water fisheries resources remain highly underutilized. It is high time for the state to make use of these resources for providing sustainable livelihoods to millions of poor rural communities. The major schemes taken up include production and supply of fish seed, development of Maun/Chaur, besides centrally sponsored schemes for development of aquaculture and welfare of fishers. The total fish production in the state is about 2.66 lakh tonnes with an average productivity of about 2.2 tonnes per ha per annum. However, the annual consumption of fish within the state is about 4.5 lakh tonnes. The underutilization of aquaculture resources, unscientific management of water bodies, and lack of entrepreneurship are some of the most obvious reasons for the gap between demand and supply.\nFish Production and Requirements\nBihar occupies the third position in inland fish production (2.66 lakh tonnes) after West Bengal (9.88 lakh tonnes) and Andhra Pradesh (6.80 lakh tonnes) as in 2003-04. It contributes about 1.6% of Bihar GDP. Bihar has bountiful natural resources of water in the form of 69,000 hectares of ponds and tanks, 90,000 hectares of ox-bow lakes, 35,000 hectares of waterlogged area, and many major rivers with a total length of 3200 km. The present fish production is about 2.675 lakh tonnes. The state produces 350 million fry against its current requirement of 2000 million. Similarly, the State requires about 4.5 lakh metric tonnes of fish for local consumption, and as such, there is a wide gap between the production and demand of fish.\nChallenges in Fisheries and Aquaculture\nThe current state of disappointing fisheries and aquaculture development in the State is attributed mainly to poor institutional setup, almost non-existence of extension services, lack of adequate resources and infrastructure facilities, absence of a conducive policy environment, defunct fisheries cooperatives, lack of professionalism among fisheries personnel, fragmented social setup, poverty, and illiteracy among the primary producers, etc.\nFuture Directions\nThe challenge is how to negotiate with these impediments, where many of them do not fall under the purview of the Department of Fisheries, and employ a practical and effective management strategy for utilization of available resources. We need to work hard for exploring appropriate approaches and develop field-tested models to make this food production sector play a greater role in poverty reduction, food and nutritional security, sustainable rural livelihood development, government revenue, and overall contribution towards the betterment of the socio-economic conditions of farmers and fishers.\nGiven the strength and opportunities outlined in the preceding paragraph, it is high time that we set a goal for managing and developing the fisheries sector in Bihar, so that eventually Bihar becomes a model for sustainable fisheries development within the next ten years. (Annexure XVII & XVIII) Apart from these, there are numerous ponds and tanks having a water area of less than 0.5 ha, with a total water area of 15,000 ha suitable for fish culture.\nMajor Rivers\nGanga, Kosi, Sone, Burhi Gandak, Gandak, Punpun, Kamla Balan, Kareh are the major rivers flowing through the State.\nMajor Reservoirs\nReservoir fisheries potential is relatively poor compared to neighboring states of UP and Jharkhand. The total number of reservoirs in Bihar is 29. All the reservoirs of the State are of either small or medium category. Some important reservoirs are Badua, Chandan, Orhni, Phulwari, Nagi.\nFish Hatcheries\nThere are a total of 29 hatcheries in the state, out of which two are in the corporate sector, 1 under the Government, and 26 under private ownership. Besides, there are 121 Government fish seed farms and 33 FEDA supported farms. (Annexure XIX)\nDuring 2004-05, the total fish production of the State was 2.675 lakh tonnes. The overall increase in fish production during the past four years from 2000-01 to 2003-04 was in the order of about 44,000 tonnes. A conservative estimate of fish requirement in the State is about 4.56 lakh tonnes (as per WHO, consumption requirement @ 11 kg/capita/annum) and it will reach over 8 lakh tonnes by 2020. The annual per capita fish consumption in the state is one of the lowest in the country, less than 1 kg/yr for nutritional security. To promote fisheries, the Department of Fisheries has 121 fish seed farms, out of which only 10% are in working condition. Presently, there are 29 fish seed hatcheries in Bihar of which 2 are under the corporate sector, and 26 in the private sector. In order to bridge the gap in the fish seed\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>STATE ANIMAL HUSBANDRY DEPARTMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Department responsible for veterinary dispensaries and mobile veterinary units, but does not have a pig breeding farm or bacon factory in the Government sector)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>State in India with underutilized fisheries and aquaculture resources, aiming for sustainable fisheries development)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEPARTMENT OF FISHERIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Department tasked with managing and developing the fisheries sector in Bihar, facing challenges such as poor institutional setup and lack of resources)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GANGA<|>GEO<|>One of the major rivers flowing through Bihar, contributing to its natural resources for fisheries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOSI<|>GEO<|>Major river in Bihar, part of the state's extensive water resources for fisheries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SONE<|>GEO<|>Another significant river in Bihar, adding to the state's potential in fisheries)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STATE ANIMAL HUSBANDRY DEPARTMENT<|>BIHAR<|>The department operates within Bihar, managing veterinary services without certain livestock facilities<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEPARTMENT OF FISHERIES<|>BIHAR<|>This department is responsible for the fisheries sector's development in Bihar, facing various challenges<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GANGA<|>BIHAR<|>The Ganga river is a crucial natural resource for Bihar's fisheries and aquaculture<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KOSI<|>BIHAR<|>Kosi river contributes to the water resources available for fisheries in Bihar<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SONE<|>BIHAR<|>Sone river is part of Bihar's natural resources, supporting the fisheries sector<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
