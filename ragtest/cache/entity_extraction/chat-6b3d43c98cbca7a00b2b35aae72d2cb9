According to a survey by the Public Health Engineering Department (PHED) in 8 districts of South Bihar, groundwater levels have increased from 4 feet to 17 feet, which has been appreciated by NITI Aayog, Government of India. As a result of the construction of soil and water conservation structures and increased groundwater levels, farmers are now able to take more than one crop per year, leading to increased cropping intensity and crop productivity in the project area.\nPriority of Fourth Agriculture Road Map\nIn view of the achievements of the previous three Agriculture Road Maps, the Fourth Agriculture Road Map (2023-28) is based on:\n* Conservation of Natural Resources: Soil and water\n* Promotion of Livelihood: Advancement of productivity systems in rain-fed areas of southern Bihar\nThe plan includes:\n* Land levelling\n* Construction of check dams\n* Aahar-Pyne renovation\n* Construction of silt detention dams\n* Ponds, etc.\nAdditionally, other activities such as Livelihood Support and Productivity Systems for landless households are proposed in rain-fed areas of Southern Bihar. After discussions with technical experts for the agricultural road map, it was decided that:\n* Provision of funds should be made for continuous monitoring, maintenance, and partial repair of the structures built under various schemes.\n* A provision of 10 percent of the total financial target will be made in the state plan for repair and maintenance of previously constructed structures.\nTo address issues such as dependence on monsoon for agriculture, climate change, excess rain-fed areas, low income, poverty, unemployment, and food security in rain-fed areas, soil and water conservation works will be done under the state plan. Areas identified under watershed development component 2.0 will be treated, and pucca check dams up to 30 feet will be constructed under Saat Nischay-2. These schemes will be implemented in 18 districts of the state:\n* Banka\n* Munger\n* Jamui\n* Nawada\n* Gaya\n* Aurangabad\n* Rohtas\n* Kaimur\n* Lakhisarai\n* Sheikhpura\n* Nalanda\n* Patna\n* Jehanabad\n* Arwal\n* Bhojpur\n* Bhagalpur\n* Buxar\n* Begusarai\nDetails of Soil and Water Conservation Structures to be Constructed\n1. Pucca Check Dam (PCD)\n   * Description: A barrier made of brick, stone, cement, sand, ballast, etc., erected in the opposite direction of the water flow of any river-drain.\n   * Purpose: To impound excess water of monsoon rains for crop irrigation. This water can be used during and after monsoon and also increases the groundwater level.\n2. Earthen Check Dam\n   * Description: Small earthen check dams made in series to collect rainwater in rugged areas and prevent soil erosion. The height is generally from 1 to 1.25 meters.\n   * Purpose: Increases the groundwater table.\n3. Rubber Check Dam\n   * Description: An inflatable structure built across a stream used for water conservation and regulating flow. When inflated, it serves as a check dam. When deflated, it functions as a flood mitigation device and sediment flushing.\n   * Implementation: Will be assessed for suitability and utility in soil and water conservation work in the Fourth Road Map.\n4. Renovation of Ahar/Pyne\n   * Description: Ancient sources of irrigation in South Bihar developed to collect rainwater.\n   * Purpose: Water collected in Ahar and Pyne is used for crop irrigation and other works.\n5. Silt Detention Dam (SDD)\n   * Description: Earthen dams constructed to collect soil particles mixed with rainwater during rains in hilly areas.\n   * Purpose: Prevents soil erosion, increases the underground water table, and helps in retaining soil moisture. A large-scale Silt Detention Dam in South Bihar has been directed by the Hon'ble Chief Minister.\n6. Water Harvesting Tank (WHT)\n   * Description: Constructed to accumulate rainwater, generally sized 150' x 100' x 8' (length x width x depth).\n   * Purpose: Used for irrigation of crops and other activities like fish farming. Coordination will be established with the fisheries department for fish farming in ponds constructed by the Directorate of Soil Conservation.\n7. Farm Pond\n   * Description: Constructed to collect rainwater, generally sized 100' x 66' x 10' (length x width x depth).\n   * Purpose: Used for irrigation of horticultural and field crops, and increases groundwater levels.\n8. Community Irrigation Well\n   * Description: Used on a large scale in plain areas for agricultural works and drinking water.\n   * Purpose: Allows farmers to easily use groundwater for irrigation. The well water is easily lifted by pump sets to irrigate crops.\n9. Community Ponds\n   * Description: Construction/renovation of community irrigation ponds to provide irrigation facilities to agricultural land of groups of villagers.\n   * Purpose: Provides alternative irrigation sources for farmers.\n10. Land Levelling\n   * Description: Rough land with mild slope is made arable by leveling with agricultural equipment.\n   * Purpose: Prevents soil erosion, ensures equal distribution of moisture, and provides a suitable base for agricultural work.\n11.
