Farmers have realized significant results from the adoption of scientific agricultural practices in the state. Although the large majority of Bihar’s farmers are small and marginal, the synergic impact of the state’s fertile soil, abundant fresh water, and availability of an adequate labor force creates greater potential for earning higher income through intensive agriculture.\nWith the establishment of Bihar Agricultural University, Sabour, under the visionary leadership of Sri Nitish Kumar, Hon’ble Chief Minister of the state, the Government of Bihar has given high priority to agriculture and allied sectors and has made wonderful developments in the state’s agriculture. With financial support from the Government of Bihar and the hard work of the farmers and youth, the state has been blessed with success in every field of agriculture.\nWith the technical support of the constituent institutes of Bihar Agricultural University, Sabour, such as Krishi Vigyan Kendras, Colleges, etc., hundreds of farmers in the state have achieved great success through their efforts and experiments in agriculture and allied sectors and have also made their socio-economic upliftment. Our scientists have tried to record the journey of some such farmers and youth from experiments to results, resulting in this book.\nThis work is a small reflection of the success achieved by the farmers through the application of the techniques transferred by the University. This book is not just a collection of success stories of some farmers and youth but also a source of inspiration for other farmers to experiment and innovate in the field of agriculture and allied sectors. I congratulate all the scientists associated with this publication for their efforts. I also extend my warm wishes to the farmers who have achieved new heights of success by taking advantage of advanced techniques and technologies.\nD. R. Singh\n\nOUR PROUD FARMERS\n1. Name: Vijay Kumar Mandal\nAge: 27 Years\nVenture: Seed Production\nVillage: Anduali\nPanchayat: Andauli\nBlock: Kishanpur\nDistrict: Supaul\nEducational Qualification: B. Tech\nInstitution Facilitating Venture: KVK, Supaul\nSEED PRODUCTION AUGMENTS FARM INCOME OF ENGINEERING GRADUATE\nIt was sheer matter of destiny that Vijay Kumar Mandal had to take up farming as an occupation. A qualified civil engineer, he had to choose farming as an occupation forced by circumstances. However, Mandal successfully developed and diversified farm activities. At present, he has no remorse about what life had offered him.\nTaking up seed production apart from the cultivation of conventional crops, Mandal has diversified farming and also registered income growth. He had to shoulder the responsibility of looking after farm activities of his family following the death of his father. The Mandal family has a total of 18 acres of farmland. Earlier, his father used to look after farm activities. Mandal took charge of agricultural activities in 2016 after completing his B. Tech course.\nCultivation of paddy, wheat, jute, and moong used to be undertaken by the Mandal family previously in comparatively more fertile 14-acre land of their total agricultural holding. He also started cultivating conventional crops after he took up farming as a livelihood occupation. However, low returns from the cultivation of conventional crops were a cause of concern for Mandal.\nHe intended to diversify farming for supplementing income. Although several options were considered by Mandal, he was unable to decide on a course of action for diversifying farming. Unable to chalk out a diversification plan, he subsequently decided to seek suggestions from scientists of Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), Supaul.\nMandal met KVK scientists in 2018 to seek their advice on farm diversification. He was advised by scientists to start seed production in addition to the cultivation of conventional crops. The KVK personnel extended him the opportunity to participate in the Bihar Skill Development Mission (BSDM) training programme on seed production.\nThis was the beginning of his association with KVK. Handholding support from the institution significantly contributed to his success. Mandal took up seed production after successfully completing the 28-day BSDM training programme. Participation in the training programme helped him gain both practical and theoretical knowledge of seed production.\nMandal earmarked two plots of 2.5 acres each for the purpose of seed production. In 2018, he started commercial seed production of both wheat and paddy. For wheat, Mandal started producing seeds of two varieties, namely DBW-14 and Sri Ram-216, while for paddy, he took up seed production of Boro PD, Sweta Mansoori, and DB 11 varieties. He also started seed production of paddy varieties Chandan Chur and Rajendra Mansoori to fulfill his personal seed requirement. On average, Mandal produces 30 quintals each of paddy and wheat seed, taking together different\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
