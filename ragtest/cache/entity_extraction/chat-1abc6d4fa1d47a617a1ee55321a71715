It showed an upward movement from 1988-89, reaching 1326.10 thousand tonnes in 1992-93.\nTable IV.2.2: Trend Growth Rate of Maize Production\nRegional Pattern\nMaize cultivation was concentrated largely in the north-west and east plains, contributing 41.46% and 44.45% respectively of the total maize production in the State. The south-west (3.32%) and plateau (10.37%) zones were less prominent. Notable districts include Samastipur (12.17%), Begusarai (17.98%), and Saharsa (10.85%).\nTable IV.2.3: Growth Trend at Zone Level (1977-91)\nDuring the second sub-period, growth accelerated to 5.62% per annum in the east alluvial plains, while it was 1.62% for the north-west alluvial plains. The south-west and plateau zones continued to decline.\nInstability in Production\nThe coefficient of variation in maize production for the State is 11.78%, suggesting relative stability. However, variations are noted across zones and districts. For example, east plains have a coefficient of variation of 15.55%, while the south-west plains have 24.12%.\nii) Area under Maize\nTable IV.2.4: Area Under Maize (1970-71 to 1992-93)\nThe area under maize declined from 990.80 thousand hectares in 1970-71 to 724.70 thousand hectares in 1992-93, with an annual decline rate of -1.83%. The decline was sharper in the second sub-period at -1.42% per annum compared to -0.71% in the first sub-period.\nRegional Pattern\nHigh maize production areas also showed high levels of area under maize, though not proportionately. The north-west and east plains occupied 35.36% and 43.26% of the maize area respectively. Major districts include Samastipur (7.88%), Begusarai (14.50%), and Saharsa (9.26%).\nTable IV.2.5: Decline in Area Under Maize (1977-91)\nThe decline in area continued in the second sub-period across all zones, with the south-west alluvial plains showing the highest rate of decline.\n\nMaize\ni) Yield of Maize\nTable IV.2.11: Yield of Maize (1970-71 to 1992-93)\nThe yield of maize in the state increased significantly from 1120 kg/ha in 1970-71 to 1830 kg/ha in 1992-93, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.50% from 1971-93. The growth rate accelerated to 5.15% during the second sub-period compared to 2.25% in the first sub-period. The state’s yield compared favorably with the national average of 1530 kg/ha but was lower than states like Karnataka (2960 kg/ha), West Bengal (2260 kg/ha), and Punjab (2020 kg/ha).\nRegional Pattern\nNorth-west Alluvial Plains: Highest yield at 1.88 t/ha\nEast Plains: 1.64 t/ha\nSouth-west Plains: 1.42 t/ha\nPlateau Districts: 0.97 t/ha\nDistrict-wise, the highest yield was in Samastipur at 2.47 t/ha, while Begusarai and Saharsa had yields of 1.98 t/ha and 1.87 t/ha respectively.\nTable IV.2.12: Growth Trend in Yield (1977-91)\nYield growth accelerated in all zones during the second sub-period, notably in the east alluvial plains (6.37%). Major districts like Begusarai (8.03%) and Saharsa (10.58%) also showed significant yield increases.\nii) Area under Maize\nTable IV.2.4: Area Under Maize (1970-71 to 1992-93)\nThe area under maize declined from 990.80 thousand hectares in 1970-71 to 724.70 thousand hectares in 1992-93, with an annual decline rate of -1.83%. The decline was more pronounced in the second sub-period at -1.42% compared to -0.71% in the first sub-period.\nRegional Pattern\nNorth-west Plains: 35.36% of maize area\nEast Plains: 43.26% of maize area\nTable IV.2.5: Decline in Area Under Maize (1977-91)\nThe decline in maize area was notable in all zones, with the south-west alluvial plains experiencing the highest rate of decline.\nWheat\ni) Production of Wheat\nTable IV.3.2: Wheat Production (1958-93)\nWheat production grew from 4.12 lakh tonnes in 1958-61 to 35.36 lakh tonnes in 1990-93, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.90%.
