Various priorities have been set for achieving the objectives of the Agriculture Road Map. Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) have been prepared for the priority areas. Along with the DPRs, ongoing projects which need to be implemented in the next five years also form part of this roadmap. Subject-wise DPRs and ongoing schemes are described in the subsequent chapters.\nAgriculture â€” Crops & Horticulture\nFor the holistic development of agriculture and allied sectors, the main target of the Fourth Agriculture Road Map is to increase per hectare productivity of crops. To enhance productivity, the use of modern agriculture techniques, particularly digital technology, will be extensively utilized. This Road Map aims at reducing the cost of cultivation and increasing realization from agriculture to all farmers, especially small and marginal farmers. The agricultural development strategies will use sustainable development techniques that do not adversely affect environmental and human health. To develop the crop and horticulture sector in the state, the use of barren, uncultivable, and current fallow land would be prioritized. Crop diversification and crop intensification shall be the focus of this Road Map. In order to achieve the goals/objectives for the overall development of crop and horticulture sectors, major priority areas (DPR) along with the ongoing schemes have been identified for the Fourth Agriculture Road Map. These areas are:\n1. Seed Development\n2. Crop Diversification\n3. Pulses and Oilseeds Mission\n4. Plant Protection\n5. Bihar Organic Farming Promotion Program\n6. Agricultural Market System Reforms\n7. Soil and Water Conservation Program\n8. Agricultural Mechanization\n9. Climate Resilient Agriculture Program\n10. Horticulture Development\n11. Use of Modern Technology in Agriculture\n12. Agricultural Education\n13. Agricultural Research\n14. Agricultural Extension\n15. Risk / Mitigation / Management\n16. Soil, Seed, Fertilizer, Pesticide Testing Laboratory\n17. Establishment of MEL Cell for Monitoring and Evaluation\nIntroduction\nSeed is an important and indispensable component of agriculture. The efficacy of other agricultural inputs depends on the quality of seed. High yielding varieties' seeds have played an important role in the Green Revolution. Higher yield can be obtained by cultivating quality seeds. Various researches and studies confirm that 15-20 percent more yield can be obtained by using quality seeds and up to 45 percent more production can be obtained as a result of proper use of other inputs and timely cultivation activities. In order to ensure the supply of quality seeds to the farmers, the Agriculture Road Map has been implemented in the state since 2008.\nAchievements of the Last Three Agricultural Road Maps\nAs a result of the action plans implemented under the Agricultural Road Map, there has been a significant improvement in the seed replacement rate. There has been a significant increase in the annual seed replacement rate of paddy, wheat, and maize crops. Under the Agriculture Road Map 2017-23, the target of seed replacement rate of paddy was kept at 50 percent, against which the average achievement of the last 5 years was 45.16 percent. Similarly, the average achievement for wheat, maize, pulses, and oilseeds was 39.10 percent, 94.39 percent, 16.14 percent, and 51.74 percent respectively, against the target of 35 percent, 90 percent, 30 percent, and 70 percent respectively. Therefore, it is evident that except for wheat and maize, the seed replacement rate for other crops, especially pulses and oilseeds, is low and it is important to increase seed production to promote the use of quality seeds in Bihar.\nVarious centrally sponsored schemes and state schemes such as Chief Minister Crash Seed Program, Integrated Seed Village Scheme, Mini-kit Seed Distribution, Certified Seed Production Program, Special Pulses and Oilseed Seed Distribution Program, and Sub Mission on Seeds and Planting Material were implemented during the Agriculture Road Map 2017-23 and a total of 34.15 lakh quintal seeds were distributed among the farmers.
