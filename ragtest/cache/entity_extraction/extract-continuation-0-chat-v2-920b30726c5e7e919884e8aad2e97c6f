For paddy and maize, coverage was lower at 35.43% and 43.15% respectively. Among non-food grains, tobacco had higher irrigation coverage at 60.76% in 1990-91.\nIrrigation was observed to significantly influence fertilizer consumption and crop intensity in the state.\nIrrigation was also observed to influence crop diversification. However, the relationship between irrigation and the area under non-food crops was negative.\nChapter X: Expansion in the Use of HYV Seeds – Temporal and Spatial Analysis\nStudies have shown that approximately 45.0% of the increase in crop output is attributable to pure yield increase. Given the soil-moisture environment, bio-chemical technology has been crucial in determining crop yield per unit area. HYV seeds are a major component of bio-chemical technology. Field data show that HYVs can absorb a larger quantity of nutrients and yield more per unit of nutrient than traditional varieties. Irrigation and fertilizer alone cannot fully impact yield increase unless accompanied by the use of HYVs. To maximize output, there needs to be a spread of HYV seeds over a larger number of crops and greater crop areas. Under the plan effort, HYV seeds have expanded in coverage, though to varying degrees across different states. While the use of HYV seeds became widespread in Punjab and Haryana, the eastern states have lagged behind. Moreover, HYV technology was available only for a few crops and mainly under irrigated conditions.\nX.2 Spread and Impact of HYV Seeds\nAs discussed in Chapter III, foodgrain production in Bihar has shown impressive performance. While irrigation has remained stagnant, fertilizer use has significantly increased. This chapter examines whether the use of HYV seeds has similarly increased in Bihar, how different zones/districts have responded, and how the use of HYV seeds has influenced the use of related inputs and crop output in Bihar. The analysis uses time series data on HYV seed area for major crops like paddy, maize, and wheat, for which HYV technology is more widely used in the state. Data was obtained from the Directorate of Economics and Statistics, Government of Bihar, covering the years 1979-80 to 1990-91.\nX.3 Paddy\nAnalysis suggests an increasing coverage of paddy HYV area in recent years in the state. It formed only 20.31% of paddy area in 1979-80, which increased to 33.86% in 1990-91. The coverage of HYV paddy area thus recorded an increase with a compound annual growth rate of 4.05% during this period. In terms of physical area, HYV seeds for paddy expanded from 10.36 lakh hectares in 1979-80 to 16.67 lakh hectares in 1990-91, showing an increase of 60.90% in eleven years. The compound annual growth rate in HYV area for paddy was 4.02% during this period. However, compared to other major states, coverage of HYV for paddy was much less in Bihar. While it was 94.17% in Punjab, 87.04% in Uttar Pradesh, 56.03% in West Bengal, 95.03% in Tamil Nadu, 90.04% in Andhra Pradesh, and 64.31% at the all-India level, for Bihar it was only 33.86% in 1990-91.\nX.4 Regional and District Analysis\nAcross different zones/districts, the coverage of HYV area for paddy was highest in the south-west alluvial plains at 65.89%. Among the districts in this zone, Rohtas (86.64%) and Bhojpur (81.95%) had relatively high coverage of HYV. In contrast, districts like Gaya (41.32%) and Nawadah (35.95%) showed lower coverage. The rate of increase in physical HYV area and percentage coverage during 1980-91 was impressive in most districts, with the rate of increase per annum in physical area as high as 8.92% in Nalanda and 7.34% in Gaya.\nCoverage of HYV seeds for paddy was relatively low in the north-west zones (25.72%) and the east plains (39.07%). In the plateau districts, it was almost negligible at 8.33%. The rate of expansion of HYV seeds was notable only in the eastern plains, with the north-west plains and plateau districts showing a slower pace of increase. Districts with relatively higher coverage of HYV seeds included Siwan (47.63%), Saran (41.52%), and West Champaran (37.73%) in the north-west plains; Purnea (77.41%) in the east plains; and Santhal Parganas (11.63%) in the plateau districts.\n\n\nX. Expansion in the Use of HYV Seeds – Temporal and Spatial Analysis\nX.5 Maize\nX.5.1 Coverage and Growth Trends\nAnalysis of maize presents a contrasting picture with the HYV area showing a shrinkage from 3.99 lakh hectares in 1979-80 to 3.82 lakh hectares in 1990-91, recording a decline at (-)0.60% per annum during this period. Coverage of HYV maize area, however, was increasing from 48.12% in 1979-80 to 57.48% in 1990-91, recording a compound annual\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PADDY<|>EVENT<|>Paddy refers to the cultivation and irrigation practices for rice, showing significant coverage and growth in HYV area over time)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHEAT<|>EVENT<|>Wheat cultivation has the highest irrigation coverage among major crops, indicating its importance in agricultural practices)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAIZE<|>EVENT<|>Maize shows a contrasting trend with a slight decline in physical area but an increase in HYV coverage, reflecting changing agricultural practices)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOBACCO<|>EVENT<|>Tobacco cultivation noted for higher irrigation coverage among non-food grains, highlighting its agricultural significance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYV SEEDS<|>EVENT<|>High Yielding Variety seeds represent a major advancement in bio-chemical technology, crucial for increasing crop output through enhanced nutrient absorption and yield)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>State in India where the use of HYV seeds has shown impressive performance in foodgrain production, despite stagnant irrigation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUNJAB<|>GEO<|>State in India known for widespread use of HYV seeds, leading in agricultural productivity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARYANA<|>GEO<|>State in India alongside Punjab, noted for extensive adoption of HYV seeds in agriculture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EASTERN STATES<|>GEO<|>Refers to states in India that have lagged behind in the adoption of HYV technology for crops)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIRECTORATE OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS, GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Government body responsible for collecting and analyzing statistical data on agriculture among other sectors in Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROHTAS<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with high coverage of HYV paddy area)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BHOJPUR<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar noted for its significant coverage of HYV paddy area)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAYA<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar showing lower coverage of HYV paddy area but notable for its rate of increase in physical HYV area)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NALANDA<|>GEO<|>District in Bihar with a high annual rate of increase in physical HYV area for paddy)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PADDY<|>BIHAR<|>Bihar has seen an increasing coverage of HYV paddy area over the years<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WHEAT<|>HYV SEEDS<|>Wheat has the highest irrigation coverage, benefiting significantly from the use of HYV seeds<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAIZE<|>HYV SEEDS<|>Despite a decline in physical area, maize HYV coverage increased, indicating a shift towards HYV seeds<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOBACCO<|>HYV SEEDS<|>Tobacco shows higher irrigation coverage, potentially benefiting from HYV technology<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYV SEEDS<|>PUNJAB<|>Punjab's widespread use of HYV seeds has led to increased agricultural productivity<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYV SEEDS<|>HARYANA<|>Haryana, like Punjab, has seen extensive adoption of HYV seeds in agriculture<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROHTAS<|>BHOJPUR<|>Both districts have relatively high coverage of HYV paddy area in Bihar<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GAYA<|>NALANDA<|>Both districts noted for their rate of increase in physical HYV area for paddy<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
