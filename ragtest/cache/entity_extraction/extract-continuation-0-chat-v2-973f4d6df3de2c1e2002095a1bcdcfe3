Sugarcane has been planted on an area of 1.43 lakh hectares, and its output is estimated to be 12.33 lakh MT.\n\n \n      2.3 Long-Term Trend in Foodgrains Production\nFoodgrain production in Bihar has shown high volatility, but there is a long-term trend of falling production in the State. Cereal production has fallen sharply from 122.29 lakh MT in 2001-02 to 81.12 lakh MT in 2005-06 (Table 2.7). This fall in production has been accompanied by an almost secular decline in the area under cereal production from 70.19 lakh hectares in 1990-91 to 65.87 lakh hectares in 2006-07. A larger part of the fall in production and area is explained by the fall in production of and area under rice (Table 2.5). Though production of wheat too has fallen, the area under it has largely been unchanged at around 20 lakh hectares. The fall in production of wheat has been due to its declining yield. While its yield in the later half of the nineties hovered around 22 qtls/hect, it has steadily fallen thereafter, reaching 21.46 qtls/hect in 2000-01 and still lower at 13.94 qtls/hect in 2005-06 (Table 2.5). Pulses too have seen a fall in production and acreage, but the fall has been moderate. Their production has fallen from 5.47 lakh MT in 2001-02 to 4.83 lakh MT in 2005-06, with acreage falling in the corresponding period from 6.94 lakh hectares to 6.55 lakh hectares. While there has been a marginal fall in the productivity of pulses, their yield rates have remained significantly above the national average. Acreage and production of coarse cereals have largely been unchanged over the last few years. For maize, there has been a rise in production from around 12 lakh MT in the late nineties to nearly 15 lakh MT in 2005-06, with almost unchanged acreage and rising productivity, from around 20 qtls/hect to 23 qtls/hect over the same period. Acreage and production of oilseeds have more or less hovered around 1.4 lakh hectares and 1.2 lakh MT in recent years with moderate fluctuations.\nThe falling trend in production and acreage of cereals has been further aggravated by deficient rainfall in 2006-07. Total cereal production is estimated to be 78.05 lakh MT, which is around 3 lakh MT less than the production figure for 2005-06 (Table 2.5). For kharif 2006-07, cereal production has been estimated at 39.64 lakh MT over an area of 34.29 lakh hectares. For rabi 2006-07, the estimate of cereal production is 38.40 lakh MT over an area of 22.53 lakh hectares. The fall in production has been largely due to the fall in area from 65.87 lakh hectares in 2005-06 to 56.82 lakh hectares in 2006-07. The second advance estimates for 2006-07 have put the production figures for coarse cereals at 10.38 lakh MT on an area of 5.17 lakh hectares and a yield of 20.09 quintals/hectare. Production of pulses has been estimated at 4.05 lakh MT and that of oilseeds at 1.11 lakh MT. Estimates put the area under sugarcane cultivation at 1.43 lakh hectares with an output of 12.33 lakh MT.\nThe observed trend of fall in acreage and production of cereals, it might be noted, is not incidental. There has been a deliberate effort by the State government during the last five years to divert land under rice and wheat cultivation towards horticulture. The plan of crop diversion has been given priority in 12 districts of the state. About 30 percent of the area under wheat in the districts of Muzaffarpur, Darbhanga, Samastipur, and Madhubani (Zone 1 districts) is being considered for diversion towards mango, litchi, and makhana. Similarly, 20 percent of crop area in the districts of East Champaran, Samastipur, Khagaria, Muzaffarpur, and Vaishali is being considered for diversion towards banana. Further, about 20 percent of rice-wheat area in the districts of Buxar, Bhojpur, Sasaram, etc. is likewise being considered for diversion towards vegetable production. Finally, about 30 percent of the total area of the state is being considered for diversion from current crops towards new crops.\n\n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n2.4 Flood Control and Drainage\nEvery year, Bihar faces the vagaries of floods and waterlogging. After the bifurcation of the State, Bihar has become the most flood-prone area in the country. The total flood-prone area of the State is 2168.80 lakh hectares, which is 73.06 percent of its total geographical area and 17.2 percent of the total flood-prone area in the country. The flood situation is most severe in the northern plains of Bihar. This is because almost all the major rivers in the State enter Bihar from Nepal in this region. The bed slope of these rivers is very sharp in Nepal, and they usually enter the State on plain lands.
