(1992-93) and maximum was 55.89 lakh ha. (1977-78). The trend growth rate was negative (-0.15% per annum), but showed positive growth in both sub-periods (0.14% and 0.27%).\nComparative Analysis (1983-93):\nBihar: Shrinkage at -0.57% per annum.\nOther States: West Bengal (1.27%), Punjab (5.05%), Andhra Pradesh (0.42%), Madhya Pradesh (0.55%), Uttar Pradesh (0.47%), All-India (0.64%).\nRegional Pattern:\nDistricts with High Area: Rohtas (5.79%), Gaya (5.07%), Bhojpur (3.93%), Ranchi (8.59%), Santhal Parganas (7.28%), East Champaran (4.10%), Purnea (5.13%).\nTrend Growth Rates (1977-91):\nDeclining Trends in All Zones: Plateau Districts (-2.96%), South-West Alluvial Plains (-1.76%), North-West Alluvial Plains (-2.96%), East Alluvial Plains (-1.76%).\nFirst Sub-Period: Decline was highest in North-West Alluvial Plains (-10.18%) and lowest in South-West Alluvial Plains (-6.87%).\nSecond Sub-Period: Expansion in all zones, highest in South-West Alluvial Plains (2.56%).\nDistrict Performance:\nHigh Expansion Rates: Darbhanga (2.39%), Begusarai (5.80%), Saharsa (4.51%), Aurangabad (3.03%), Nalanda (4.45%), Nawadah (4.39%).\niii) Yield of Paddy\nTrends:\n1970-71 to 1992-93: Yield increased from 0.68 tonnes/ha. (1982-83) to 1.23 tonnes/ha. (1988-89), with an average growth rate of 1.34% per annum.\nSub-Periods: Higher growth rate in the second sub-period (2.32% per annum) compared to the first (0.24%).\nComparative Analysis (1983-93):\nBihar: 1.78% growth in yield, lower than West Bengal (5.17%), Uttar Pradesh (5.02%), Tamil Nadu (4.27%), and Madhya Pradesh (3.62%).\nYield Levels: Punjab (3.293 t/ha.), Tamil Nadu (3.117 t/ha.), Haryana (2.753 t/ha.), All-India average (1.743 t/ha.), Bihar (1.001 t/ha.)\nOverall, Bihar’s paddy production showed an increasing trend, but it lags in yield and production compared to other major states. The state witnessed a significant improvement during the second sub-period, although it still struggles with stability and yield compared to its counterparts.\n\nRegional Pattern\nIV.1.18\nAcross different zones/districts, the south-west zone displayed relatively higher yield (1.58 t/ha.) than the north-west plains (1.08 t/ha.) and the plateau districts (0.98 t/ha.). In the latter zones, the yield of paddy was even less than the State average of 1.17 t/ha. Inter-district comparison suggests that districts of south-west plains displayed higher yield of paddy as compared to districts of other zones. It ranged between 2.03 t/ha. in Nalanda and 1.44 t/ha. in Gaya. Among the districts of north-west plains, West Champaran (1.31 t/ha.), followed by Saran (1.26 t/ha.), Siwan (1.22 t/ha.), and Gopalganj (1.21 t/ha.) showed relatively higher yield of paddy. On the other hand, Vaishali (0.81 t/ha.), Samastipur (0.81 t/ha.), Muzaffarpur (0.83 t/ha.), and Darbhanga (0.91 t/ha.) were at the lower end. In the east plains, Bhagalpur (1.43 t/ha.) and Munger (1.41 t/ha.) displayed relatively better yield. Saharsa, on the other hand, with a yield of 0.74 t/ha., lagged far behind. Despite adversaries in terms of climate, districts of plateau zone did not lag behind those in the north-west and east plains as yield level was more or less similar in their cases. Santhal Parganas (1.17 t/ha.) and Giridih (1.12 t/ha.) were way ahead in this respect.\nIV.1.19\nThe trend rates of growth were positive in all the four zones during 1977-91. The rate of increase in yield was relatively high for the north-west alluvial plains (2.81%), followed by the south-west alluvial plains (2.51%). Performance of the east alluvial plains was modest with a rate of increase in yield at 1.67%. For plateau districts, the rate of increase in yield was positive but marginal at 0.93% only.\nIV.1.20\nAnalysing the rate of growth in paddy yield separately for the two sub-periods, it is observed\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India that has shown varying trends in paddy production and yield, with overall increasing trends but lagging behind other states in terms of yield and production\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEST BENGAL<|>GEO<|>A state in India noted for a positive growth rate in paddy yield\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUNJAB<|>GEO<|>A state in India with a significant growth rate in paddy yield, leading in yield levels\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANDHRA PRADESH<|>GEO<|>A state in India mentioned for its growth rate in paddy yield\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MADHYA PRADESH<|>GEO<|>A state in India with a noted growth rate in paddy yield\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UTTAR PRADESH<|>GEO<|>A state in India with a positive growth rate in paddy yield\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAMIL NADU<|>GEO<|>A state in India with a high growth rate in paddy yield, surpassing Bihar\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARYANA<|>GEO<|>A state in India with a high yield level of paddy\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROHTAS<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar with a high area under paddy cultivation\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAYA<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar with a significant area under paddy cultivation\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BHOJPUR<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar noted for its area under paddy cultivation\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RANCHI<|>GEO<|>A district with the highest area under paddy cultivation mentioned in the text\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SANTHAL PARGANAS<|>GEO<|>A district noted for a high area under paddy cultivation\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EAST CHAMPARAN<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar with a notable area under paddy cultivation\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NALANDA<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar with both a high area and yield of paddy cultivation\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DARBHANGA<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar with a high expansion rate in paddy cultivation\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEGUSARAI<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar with the highest expansion rate in paddy cultivation mentioned\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAHARSA<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar with a significant expansion rate in paddy cultivation but lagging in yield\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>WEST BENGAL<|>Bihar's paddy yield growth is compared to West Bengal's, indicating a regional comparison in agricultural performance<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>PUNJAB<|>Bihar's paddy yield is significantly lower than Punjab's, highlighting the disparities in agricultural productivity<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>NALANDA<|>Nalanda is a district in Bihar that contributes significantly to the state's paddy production<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>DARBHANGA<|>Darbhanga is a district in Bihar noted for its high expansion rate in paddy cultivation<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>SAHARSA<|>Saharsa, despite its expansion in paddy cultivation, shows Bihar's challenges in achieving high yields<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
