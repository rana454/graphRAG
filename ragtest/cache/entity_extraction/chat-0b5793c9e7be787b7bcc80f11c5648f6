It has been estimated that during the kharif season, about 23% of paddy area remains waterlogged where the adoption of modern technology is either nil or low and consequently, the crop yields are low.\nSimilarly, there are frequent occurrences of drought in the districts of Munger, Nawada, Rohtas, Bhojpur, Aurangabad, and Gaya. The extent of irrigated area in these 6 Districts shows that, except for district Munger where the irrigated area is 26.4%, all the other districts have a high percentage of irrigated area. Zone III, where these districts are located, has an average of 1104 mm of annual rainfall. With such rainfall in the region and most of the districts having an irrigated area higher than the State average, it is a pity that they are still being identified as drought-prone. The Planning Commission has already sanctioned watershed development projects for 8 Districts of Southern Bihar – Banka, Jamui, Gaya, Munger, Aurangabad, Rohtas, Bhabua, and Nawada. Once implemented, there should be no problem of drought in the Southern Zone.\nIt is true that rainfall may be erratic. Bihar can certainly follow the example of Rajasthan where, with less than 400 mm of rainfall, the State has horticulture by rainwater harvesting like the Kund Horticulture Project of Rajasthan.\nStructure of Agricultural Produce\nAgriculture is at the core of Bihar’s economy. The contribution of agriculture and its allied sector to the state domestic product was 40% in 2003-04. Although this is a reduction from 48.5% in 1980, it remains among the highest in the country.\nDuring 1980 - 1992, Bihar’s agriculture and allied sector grew at 1.6% per annum, compared with the national average of 3.1%. In fact, it was the lowest among most of the states. However, since 1993, growth in Bihar’s agricultural GSDP has accelerated. While the all-India agricultural GDP grew at 2.2% per annum between 1993 and 2003, the corresponding figure for Bihar was 2.7%, which was next only to West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh among the major Indian states. A study for the period 1995-96 to 2004-05 not only confirms the above findings but also shows that Bihar went ahead of both these states, though marginally (Annexure IV).\nIt may be stated that with the growing commercialization of agriculture, cropping pattern changes reflect the expectation of net return from the land possessed by the farmers. A bird’s eye view of the data in Annexure V will reveal that in TE 2001, the total value of farm output including livestock was Rs.3171 million (the share of livestock being Rs.913 million or about 29%). In food crops, fruits, and vegetables accounted for nearly 49.7% of the total value, followed by rice 19.7%, wheat 12.0%, pulses 3.7%, maize 2.9%, and other crops 8.7%. Among the livestock products, which accounted for 29% of the total value of agricultural output, milk constituted 49.3% of the total value, followed by meat 24.4% and other products 26.3%.\nBihar also produces about 2.6 lakh tonnes of fish annually. There are about 2 lakh hectares of permanent water area and 1.2 lakh hectares of seasonal water area in the state. Besides, about 5 lakh hectares of paddy area are under deep water condition, which can be exploited for fisheries. The fish production constituted about 1.85% of the state’s GSDP in 2004-05 (Government of Bihar, Economic Survey, 2006-07).\nIt may be seen further that the per hectare value of output of major crops in Bihar (Rs.3017) is a shade lower than that of all India (Rs.3576). Rice and wheat are the major crops of Kharif and Rabi seasons occupying nearly 3.7 and 2.1 million hectares respectively. In addition, maize is cultivated in about 4-5 lakh ha during Kharif and Rabi seasons respectively. Average yield of rice-wheat cropping system is 1.45-2.19 t/ha as against the production potential (experimental yields at research farms) of 4.5-5 t/ha. Similarly, the average maize yield of the State is about 2.38 t/ha as against its yield potential of 6 t/ha. Even though the state is rich in soil and water resources, the average yields of rice, wheat, and maize in the State are only about 32%, 44%, and 40% respectively of potential yields. Thus, there is considerable scope to increase the productivity of rice, wheat, and maize in Bihar. The State has the potential for the development of horticulture. Intervention for production, processing, post-harvest management, and marketing in order to avail maximum benefits under the National Horticulture Mission launched in the country, including 16 districts in Bihar, is expected to harness the full potential of this sector.\nChapter 2: Features and Present Position\nA. Crop Husbandry\nAgriculture is the mainstay of the state’s economy. Nearly 60% of the area under cultivation in Bihar is rainfed. A wide variety of crops, viz. cereals, oil\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
