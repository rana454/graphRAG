Bhagalpur, however, showed an increasing trend in both sub-periods. Saharsa maintained a steady trend at 2.21% even in the second sub-period. In the case of Katihar, the rate of increase in jute area slackened from 3.70% in the first sub-period to 1.29% in the second sub-period.\nIV.8.9 Yield of Jute\nMuch of the increase in jute production emanated from yield increase only, as the area showed negligible expansion over this period. The yield of jute in the state was 0.545 t/ha. in 1970-71, which increased to 0.765 t/ha. in 1992-93. The minimum yield level was 0.451 t/ha. in 1980-81 and the maximum was 0.822 t/ha. in 1991-92. The trend rate of growth in yield level was 2.54% during 1971-93. Analyzing the trend rate of growth separately for two sub-periods, it was observed to be increasing in both sub-periods, growing at 1.24% per annum in the first sub-period and 1.65% per annum in the second sub-period. Compared to West Bengal, the yield level was relatively much less for Bihar. While it was 1.98 t/ha. for West Bengal, it was 0.77 t/ha. in Bihar in 1990-93. The yield level was higher in West Bengal by almost 157%. The rate of increase in yield was also significantly higher at 3.42% in West Bengal compared to 2.95% in Bihar during 1983-93.\nIV.8.10 Regional Pattern of Yield\nThe yield level of jute was much higher in non-traditional jute-growing areas. It was as high as 0.888 t/ha. in the north-west plains, followed by 0.783 t/ha. in the plateau districts, as compared to 0.593 t/ha. in the traditional jute-growing districts of the east plains. Analysis at the district level also suggests a similar pattern. The non-traditional jute-growing districts showed higher yield levels than traditional jute-growing districts. It was as high as 0.944 t/ha. in West Champaran, 0.922 t/ha. in Vaishali, and 0.902 t/ha. in Darbhanga of the north-west plains, as compared to 0.525 t/ha. in Purnea, 0.764 t/ha. in Saharsa, and 0.685 t/ha. in Katihar of the east plains. Even the districts of the plateau zone displayed higher yield levels of jute in the range of 0.748-0.800 t/ha.\nIV.8.11 Trend Rates of Growth in Yield\nThe trend rate of growth in the yield of jute in the east alluvial plains was low at 1.36% per annum compared to 5.57% in the north-west plains during 1977-91. Across different districts, while it showed a declining trend at (-)0.19% in Begusarai, it showed an increasing trend in all other districts of the east plains. It was as high as 4.06% in Bhagalpur, followed by 1.88% in Katihar and 1.36% in Purnea. Saharsa had a relatively low trend rate of growth at 0.81% only. However, the pattern shifted in these districts in the second sub-period, with Begusarai showing a phenomenal increase in yield at 28.0% per annum. Purnea, on the other hand, reversed to a declining trend at (-)5.12% per annum during this period. In Saharsa, the yield level accelerated during the second sub-period to 2.25% per annum. Katihar, however, experienced slackening growth in yield from 4.46% in the first sub-period to 0.19% per annum during the second sub-period.\nConclusions\nIV.8.12 Summary\nThe following broad conclusions are thus arrived at:\nBihar has been a traditional grower of jute. However, it lagged far behind West Bengal in terms of area coverage as well as yield of jute. The production of jute recorded a significant increase in the state. The rate of increase in jute production was higher in the first sub-period, but slackened to a lower rate in the second sub-period.\nThe increase in jute production was more due to yield increase, as the area under jute remained static.\nThe production of jute in the state was region-specific, with the east plains showing a dominant share. Among the districts of this zone, jute was produced largely in Purnea, Katihar, and Saharsa. In all these districts, there was a significant increase in jute production due to both area expansion and yield increase.\n\nTable IV.8.1\nArea, Production, and Yield of Jute Crop in Bihar During 1971-93\nTable IV.8.2\nCompound Annual Rate of Growth (%)\nFigures in parentheses indicate the level of significance.\n \nIV.9 Potato\nBihar was the third largest state in the country in potato production, following Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. Potato formed 21.17% of the non-food crop area in the state.
