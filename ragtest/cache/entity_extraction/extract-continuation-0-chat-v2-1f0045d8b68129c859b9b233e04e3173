The area under fruits and vegetables covers about 10% of the gross cropped area but generates income of about 50% of the total value of all crops produced in Bihar. Bihar has a monopoly in the production of litchi and makhana, producing 70% of the total litchi production and 80% of makhana in the country. Mango is also an important fruit crop in Bihar, cultivated in approximately 1.4 lakh ha of land. Bihar constitutes about 7% of the area and 10% of the production of mango in the country, and per hectare mango productivity is higher in Bihar (8.75 tons/ha) than the national average of 6.14 tons/ha. Bihar is also a leader in banana production, producing 5% of bananas on 4% of banana area in the country. Potato is an important horticultural crop in Bihar, where the state ranks third in potato production and recently recorded the highest yield per hectare in Nalanda district in the country. Bihar has significant potential in potato production as well as in vegetables like cauliflower, cabbage, brinjal, tomato, lady’s finger, and cucurbits. Spices like chilies, turmeric, ginger, and garlic are grown on about 70 thousand hectares of land, accounting for more than 10% of the total production in the country. The state also has great opportunities to cultivate medicinal and aromatic plants. In this context, KVKs of Bihar are playing an important role in horticulture development by providing quality planting material of 233,500 numbers to the state government.\nSEED PRODUCTION\nKVKs took up seed and planting material production programs to improve the supply of quality seed and enhance the seed replacement rate of this zone as well as to enhance the production and productivity of major cereals, pulses, oilseeds, and other crops. During 2012-13, the KVKs of Zone-II produced 45,002.99 q of seeds, which were made available to 54,721 farmers. This seed production brought an amount of Rs. 697.0 lakhs as revenue to the KVKs. The KVKs of Bihar alone contributed 22,038.87 q of seeds for an estimated value of Rs. 2,85,33,594.\nAmong all the crops, the highest quantity (25,421.98 q) of seeds were produced in paddy with varieties including MTU-7029, Sahabagi, Navin, Lalat, Rajendra Masuri, Swarna Sub 1, MTU-1010, Anjali, BPT-5204, Abhishek, MTU 1001, and others. For the production of 7,776.64 q of quality seeds of wheat, the varieties identified by KVKs were HW 2045, HW 2824, PBW 711, PBW-343, HD-2733, CBW-38, K-9107, HUW-468, K-307, PBW-43, etc. In oilseeds, mustard was the most important crop for seed production, with 548.08 q of seeds produced, including varieties like Rajendra Anukul, Pusa Mahak, Rohini, Rajendra Sufalam, Pusa Agrani, Shivani, B-9, Pusa Jaikisan, NDR 8501, and others. In pulse crops, varieties like Subrata, Maitree, HUL-57, PL-406, Arun, Jul-57, PL-4, DPL-62, and DPL-15 were selected by the KVKs for the production of 578.4 q lentil seeds, followed by pea (291.19 q), black gram (282.14 q), and red gram (234.73 q). The KVKs also included commercial crops like potato and sugarcane for seed production, with 3,184.57 q and 4,573.38 q of seeds produced, respectively. For vegetables, the KVKs included almost all the vegetables for seed production, with the highest produce in onion (66.52 q) followed by tomato (10.16 q). The details of seed production in the zone are given in the following table to indicate the contribution of KVKs of Bihar in this sector.\nPLANTING MATERIALS\nApart from producing seeds, the KVKs also took up programs on the production of planting materials at a large scale considering the needs of this zone with respect to vegetables, fruits, plantation crops, forest species, and others. Total planting materials produced during the year were 12.97 lakhs in number, which was equivalent to a revenue of Rs. 82.79 lakhs.\nAmong vegetables, seedling production was considered for tomato, cauliflower, brinjal, chili, cabbage, and capsicum. In tomato, 253,309 seedlings were raised, followed by brinjal (127,440), cabbage (104,897), chili (67,411), and capsicum (5,252).\nIn fruit crops, the highest number of saplings was prepared for mango (133,326), followed by papaya (95,719), guava (34,280), litchi (19,099), banana (6,520), and others. Production of planting materials also included ornamental plants like Croton, Ashok, medicinal and aromatic plants, plantation crops, spices, condiments, and forest species. The KVKs also produced planting materials of flowers including marigold, tuberose, chrysanthemum, and dahlia.\nPlanting Material\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India known for its significant contribution to agriculture, particularly in the production of litchi, makhana, mango, banana, and potato.
