In 1992-93, credit per hectare in Bihar was much lower compared to states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Punjab.\nChallenges: With co-operatives and Regional Rural Banks facing issues, commercial banks became the primary credit source. Despite increased deposits, the credit flow remained stagnant, affecting agricultural investment.\nOperational Holdings and Tenancy Status\nLand Holdings: There was a rapid increase in the number of operational holdings, reducing the average size and making them less viable.\nTenancy and Fragmentation: High tenancy (around 60%) and significant land fragmentation (17-20 parcels per holding) hindered investment and technology adoption.\nChanging Land Use Pattern\nAgricultural Land: The availability of agricultural land was low in Bihar (62.50%) compared to states like Punjab and U.P.\nNet Sown Area: Declining at a rate of -0.79% per annum due to factors like current fallow, miscellaneous trees, and non-agricultural use.\nGross Cropped Area: Declining due to stagnant and inefficient irrigation practices.\nPolicy Implications\nLow Output: Bihar’s agriculture remained subsistence despite the use of modern inputs. Low yields were due to inadequate use of irrigation, fertilizers, and high-yield varieties (HYV) seeds, along with poor credit flow.\nLand and Tenancy Issues: High tenancy rates, land fragmentation, and inefficient input use restricted growth. The technology available was often not suited to local conditions.\nPoints of Action\nWater Management: Implement area-specific plans to address water logging and promote drainage in flood-prone areas.\nSoil and Land: Develop plans to manage barren land and soil erosion, especially in plateau districts.\nIrrigation: Focus on low-cost protective irrigation and manage land disputes to facilitate cultivation.\nResearch and Development: Increase R&D for nucleus HYV seeds for various crops, and improve seed multiplication and storage facilities.\nCredit and Investment: Relax credit norms for tenant cultivators, promote compost use, and ensure regular maintenance of irrigation infrastructure.\nIrrigation Efficiency: Encourage farm electrification and manage irrigation through panchayats or extension networks.\nCrop Development: Adopt area-specific plans for both food and non-food crops to enhance growth and productivity.\n\nA. MAJOR FINDINGS\na) Performance of Foodgrains\nGrowth Performance:\nThe growth performance of foodgrains production in Bihar at 0.48% per annum was one of stagnation till 1982-83.\nThe period since 1983-84, however, heralded the beginning of a new era triggering an increase in foodgrains production in the State at 2.73% per annum.\nThe rate of growth in foodgrains production showed an accelerating trend during this period. With the growth rate showing a low coefficient of variation during the second sub-period, the increasing trend in foodgrains production could be considered to have stabilized in the State.\nSeasonal Performance:\nMuch of the increase in foodgrains production was experienced in the rabi season (4.93%), as the production of foodgrains in the kharif season continued to stagnate (0.59%).\nThe increase in foodgrains production in the rabi season was due to both area and yield expansion.\nKharif Foodgrains:\nDespite the yield of kharif foodgrains showing an increasing trend at 1.90% per annum, the production of kharif foodgrains remained stagnant (0.59%).\nThis stagnation was due to a sharp decline in the area under kharif foodgrains (-1.32%).\nGeographical Distribution:\nThe share of the north-west plains (31.77%) and south-west plains (29.82%) in total foodgrains production of the State was relatively more compared to other agro-climatic zones.\nDistricts showing a high share in foodgrains production of the state included Rohtas (7.30%), Bhojpur (5.65%), Purnea (5.14%), and Santhal Parganas (4.77%).\nRate of Increase:\nThe rate of increase in foodgrains production in the second sub-period was high in the zones of the plains, with the south-west taking the lead (5.74%).\nThe plateau zone continued to lag behind with a trend growth rate of 3.27%.\nDistrict Growth:\nDistricts experiencing a relatively high rate of growth (above 5.0%) during the second sub-period included Madhubani, Samastipur, Patna, Nawadah, Nalanda, Purnea, Saharsa, and Giridih.\nThese did not form one geographical cluster, except a smaller patch of Patna, Nalanda, and Nawadah.\nDistricts with high growth were not necessarily those with high foodgrains production or with high growth in yield.\nYield Increase:\nDistricts showing a relatively high increase in the yield of foodgrains (above 4.50%) included East Champaran, Madhubani, Samastipur, and Vaishali in the north-west; Munger in the east; and Gaya, Santhal Parganas, Giridih, Hazaribagh, and Palamu in the plateau region.\nDistricts showing a relatively high rate of increase in area under foodgrains included Darbhanga and Muzaffarpur in the north-west; Saharsa in the east; and Nalanda and Nawadah in the south-west plains.\nb) Crop-wise Performance\nCereal Crops:\nAmong the cereal crops, paddy, maize, and wheat were the important ones. All these crops showed an increasing trend in output.\nThe rate of growth was relatively more for wheat (3.50%) and maize (3.80%) during the second sub-period. For paddy, the growth rate was 2.59\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
