The main risks identified for the population dependent on agriculture are:\nPrice risks\nProduction risks\nInstitutional risks\nPersonal risks\nEnterprise risk\nBusiness risks\nBihar is not an exception, and these risks become ever more prominent given the importance of agriculture in the state and the gross linkages to livelihoods and industries.\nPrice Fluctuations\nPrices of agricultural commodities fluctuate widely from year to year:\nThe co-efficient of variation in the farm harvest prices of paddy was as high as 45.4 percent during 1980-81 to 2002-03. In the case of wheat, it was 44.9 percent, and in maize, it was 38.9 percent.\nThe coefficients of variation in the yields of rice, wheat, and maize were 23.4, 16.4, and 30.3 percent respectively.\nThus, crop farming in Bihar is not only unprofitable at present but also unstable and risky. About 71 percent of the variations in output were explained by variations in rainfall, irrigation, and farm harvest prices. Since variability in rainfall and farm harvest prices is high, the production process is quite risky. Along with low profitability, erratic rainfall and fluctuating market prices act as disincentives for farmers to invest in modernization of agriculture.\nInformal Risk Management\nIn the absence of availability and access to formal risk management mechanisms in a rural environment, the asset-poor households seek to manage risks through various informal strategies (diversify their crops, store grain, engage in informal savings and credit, favor traditional techniques over modern technology, and enter into share-cropping arrangements). Informal risk management provides only partial coverage in case of systemic losses, leaving poor producers vulnerable to extreme poverty, malnutrition, and also dampens long-term agricultural growth.\nThere also seems to be a trade-off between market-based risk management solutions and public or State-sponsored schemes. A more formalized management of production risk in agriculture necessitates a risk-pooling mechanism like insurance, whereas in price risk management, it is done by accessing commodity derivative markets.\nNatural Hazards in Bihar\nGiven that more than 80% of Bihar’s population is dependent on agriculture and related activities and Bihar happens to be one of the most disaster-prone states in India, the role of risk financing in the context of hedging agricultural risk from climatic shocks becomes critical. It is imperative to develop sophisticated ways of market and government mechanisms for risk transfer. Pre-disaster initiatives (ex ante) need to be given more impetus than post-disaster (ex post) events. These initiatives aim to provide hitherto unforeseen resilience to the rural communities and also bring out transparency and efficiency to the whole effort.\nDisaster Profile and Risk Transfer\nThe disaster profile of the state further compounds the situation. While the northern parts experience frequent floods, southern parts are affected by drought. The possibility of floods and the resultant statewide construction of flood control mechanisms like embankments have been the mandate of successive administrations. However, these mechanisms have had mostly post-disaster safeguards, and while the need for a pre-disaster (ex ante) approach has been long felt, little has been done in this regard. In the recent past, within the space of disaster safeguards, there is a valuable shift in focus from only ex post to also include ex ante frameworks.\nRisk Transfer for Natural Disasters – Administration’s Mandate\nUshering in a paradigm shift, the Government of India has invested in disaster mitigation and preparedness strategies like Early Warning Systems. However, public financing is not always sufficient for relief measures:\nThe assistance amount demanded by states during the period 1995-98 was around Rs. 24,000 Crores, while the total corpus was barely Rs. 700 Crores.\nSimilarly, during 1998-2002, the states sought assistance of Rs. 60,000 crores, while the amount released through NFCR and NCCF was just Rs. 9,000 Crores.\nIn addition to a relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction strategy, inclusion of risk transfer mechanisms could build substantial efficiency into the disaster management strategy for severe, low-probability events. We expect the risk transfer mechanisms to bring in the following efficiencies:\nImprovement in response time to disaster relief payouts\nEfficient ex-ante (pre-disaster) financing complementing the corpus fund drawn from public finances\nEfficient and greater transparency in targeting of relief for people affected by calamities like floods or droughts\nSuch a product delivery would require technical demonstration of the feasibility of quantifying flood risk, through geophysical and statistical modeling. Mapping using geo-information technology and remote sensing is essential for the development of natural hazard risk insurance and also helps demonstrate how this risk can be transferred through insurance. Also, identification of the Below Poverty Line communities and their exposure to the risk would help in developing a transparent pre-defined index-based risk management product.\nOperational Aspects of Risk Transfer\nThe risk transfer design could also include operational aspects of relief and rehabilitation. For example, the flood risk hedging could be designed such that flood relief and rehabilitation operations would be carried out by Village Disaster Preparedness Committees (VDPCs) who are closer to the community.\nThis infrastructure has multiple utilities:\nThe mapping and targeting activities, if done in an effective manner, would help in timely delivery of relief, ensuring efficient targeting.\nRehabilitation activities could be done more effectively through this operational design of the risk transfer.\nAlso, the availability of the risk transfer mechanisms would help in proper infrastructure and reconstruction for disaster-affected geographies. For example, an earthquake causes huge losses to property supporting economies dependent on agriculture, livestock, or fishery. The higher the losses, the concomitant payouts are higher. So, the insurers have an incentive to spend more on\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>Bihar is a state in India where agriculture plays a crucial role in the livelihoods of its population, making it vulnerable to various risks including price fluctuations, production instability, and natural disasters like floods and droughts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOVERNMENT OF INDIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Government of India has invested in disaster mitigation and preparedness strategies, including Early Warning Systems, to manage the risk of natural disasters in states like Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VILLAGE DISASTER PREPAREDNESS COMMITTEES (VDPCS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Local committees in Bihar tasked with carrying out flood relief and rehabilitation operations, playing a key role in the operational aspects of risk transfer and disaster management)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>GOVERNMENT OF INDIA<|>The Government of India supports Bihar through disaster mitigation and preparedness strategies to manage agricultural risks and natural disasters<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VILLAGE DISASTER PREPAREDNESS COMMITTEES (VDPCS)<|>BIHAR<|>VDPCs operate within Bihar to carry out flood relief and rehabilitation, indicating a direct involvement in the state's disaster management efforts<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
