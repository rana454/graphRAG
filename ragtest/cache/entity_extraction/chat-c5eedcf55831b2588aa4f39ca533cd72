In summer paddy production, districts of Katihar (42.46%), Purnea (20.52%), and Saharsa (6.83%) in the east plains; and West Champaran (8.80%) in the north-west plains dominated.\na) Production\nIV.1.25\nProduction of winter paddy showed an increasing trend in the north-west alluvial plains (1.53%), the east alluvial plains (0.97%), and the south-west alluvial plains (2.66%). However, it showed a declining trend in the plateau zone (-0.38%). On the other hand, production of paddy in autumn showed an increasing trend in all the four agro-climatic zones ranging between 4.77% and 0.70%. Production of summer paddy, however, showed a contrasting picture. While the north-west (1.17%) and the east alluvial plains (10.37%) showed an increasing trend, the zones of south-west and plateau districts showed a declining trend. The rate of decline was significantly high at (-)11.98% in the case of south-west alluvial plains and marginal at (-)0.18% for the plateau districts.\nIV.1.26\nAnalysing the trend of growth separately for different seasons across different districts, it is observed that districts of the north-west alluvial plains showed an increasing trend in autumn paddy production. The rate of increase was relatively high in Siwan (8.15%), followed by Gopalganj (7.93%) and Saran (6.77%), all forming one homogenous cluster. Among the districts of the east alluvial plains, Begusarai (20.51%) and Bhagalpur (13.68%) showed a high rate of increase in the production of autumn paddy. On the other hand, Munger and Katihar showed declines at (-)10.00% and (-)4.05% respectively in autumn paddy output. Most of the districts in the south-west alluvial plains showed an increasing trend. Of them, Gaya had the highest rate of increase (9.55%). Amidst such a pattern, however, Aurangabad and Bhojpur, both forming a homogenous cluster, showed a declining trend in autumn paddy output. Performance of districts in the plateau zone was equally impressive with only one district, namely Singhbhum, displaying a declining trend at (-)3.33% in autumn paddy production.\n\nRegional Pattern\nIV.1.27\nPerformance of winter paddy production varied across zones. In the south-west alluvial plains, the trend was increasing, ranging between 4.33% and 0.29%. Conversely, the north-west alluvial plains exhibited a mixed pattern. Districts such as Sitamarhi (-1.56%), Samastipur (-1.79%), Muzaffarpur (-0.23%), and Vaishali (-0.76%) showed a declining trend, forming a cluster. However, districts like Darbhanga, Madhubani, East Champaran, Gopalganj, Saran, Siwan, and West Champaran demonstrated an increasing trend, ranging from 6.86% to 0.49%. In the east alluvial plains, Purnea (-1.30%), Saharsa (-0.40%), and Katihar (-0.35%) experienced a decline, forming a cluster under Koshi Command. In contrast, Bhagalpur, Begusarai, and Munger showed an increasing trend in winter paddy production, ranging between 5.90% and 2.18% per annum. Among the plateau zone districts, Santhal Parganas (-1.01%), Singhbhum (-0.79%), Palamu (-2.66%), and Ranchi (-0.16%) showed a decline, whereas Giridih (2.38%), Hazaribagh (2.03%), and Dhanbad (0.95%) exhibited an increasing trend.\nIV.1.28\nThe increasing trend in summer paddy production at the state level was largely due to the impressive performance of specific districts, as most showed a declining trend. The districts with impressive performance included Darbhanga (6.14%), Madhubani (13.57%), Samastipur (3.14%), Sitamarhi (7.43%), Vaishali (3.20%), and West Champaran (1.05%) in the north-west alluvial plains; Begusarai (6.67%), Katihar (15.36%), and Purnea (17.80%) in the east alluvial plains; and Santhal Parganas (9.56%) and Singhbhum (3.00%) in the plateau zone. Other districts in different agro-climatic zones showed a declining trend, with the rate of decline being significant in the south-west alluvial plains, ranging between (-)25.47% and (-)2.61%. Notable declines in summer paddy output included Gopalganj (-13.01%) and Siwan (-12.07%) in the north-west; Aurangabad (-17.86%), Bhojpur (-25.47%), Gaya (-12.00%), Nalanda (-13.60%), and Patna (-14.16%) in the south-west; and Giridih (-21.47%) and Dhanbad (-15.38%) in the plateau zone.\nArea\nIV.1.29\nThe area under autumn paddy showed an increasing trend in the north-west (2.84%) and a marginal increase in the east alluvial plains\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
