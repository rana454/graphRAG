All these rivers drain into the main Ganga stream.\nThe six river systems from Karmnasa to Chandan, draining the southern part of Bihar, originate primarily from Indian territories in Bihar, Jharkhand, and Chhattisgarh, whereas seven river systems from Ghaghra to Mahananda drain North Bihar. Most of these river systems in North Bihar originate in Tibet and Nepal, and hence, they are international rivers. Excess rainfall in Tibet and Nepal directly affects the flow of these river systems, causing extensive floods in North Bihar, which has become a recurring phenomenon.\nAgricultural Economy\nAgriculture is the backbone of Bihar’s economy, employing 81% of the workforce and generating about 42% of the State Domestic Product. The state, with a geographical area of nearly 94.2 thousand sq. km, has the natural endowment of fertile soil, good rainfall, plenty of water resources, and agro-climatic conditions highly suitable for growing almost all types of crops three times a year. In Bihar, agriculture is not only the source of livelihood but also generates raw materials for agro-based industries, which has immense potential in the state.\nAgro-Climatic Zones\nOn the basis of soil characterization, rainfall, temperature, and terrain, the state is divided into three main agro-climatic zones:\nZone-I: North West Alluvial Plains\nDistricts: East and West Champaran, Gopalganj, Siwan, Saran, Sitamarhi, Muzaffarpur, Vaishali, Madhubani, Begusarai, Sheohar, Darbhanga, and Samastipur.\nArea: 32,665 sq. km\nAverage Annual Rainfall: 1234.7 mm\nSoil: Mostly calcareous, with neutral, acidic, or saline soil found in the Northern part.\nZone-II: North East Alluvial Plains\nDistricts: Purnea, Katihar, Saharsa, Supaul, Araria, Kisanganj, Madhepura, and Khagaria\nArea: 20,797.4 sq. km\nAverage Annual Rainfall: 1382.2 mm\nCharacteristics: Area full of streams with abandoned or dead channels of river Kosi. Frequent and sudden change of course has left small lakes and shallow marshes.\nZone-III: South Bihar Alluvial Plains\nDistricts: Bhagalpur, Banka, Munger, Jamui, Lakhisarai, Seikhpura, Gaya, Aurangabad, Jehanabad, Nawada, Arwal, Nalanda, Patna, Bhojpur, Buxar, Kaimur, and Rohtas.\nArea: 40,875.5 sq. km\nAverage Annual Rainfall: 1102.1 mm\nSoil: Mostly medium to heavy textured throughout the depth of the profile.\nTal, Diara, and Chaur Land\nIn the south of the natural levee of the Ganga, there is a vast stretch of backwater known as ‘Tal (low order monsoon stream)’ land extending from Buxar to Pakur in Jharkhand, where most of the rivers and rivulets coming from the south get lost. The estimated area under Tal is about 1.00 lakh ha. In addition to Tal land, the state has about 4.0 lakh ha of ‘Diara land (saucer-shaped flood plain of a river)’ under flood plains of river Ganga and Ghaghra. The state also has about 4.0 lakh ha of ‘Chaur land (remnants of river course)’, which is highly suitable for fish farming. The Tal, Diara, and Chaur land are inundated by water for varying periods and are difficult to manage.\nLand Utilization Pattern\nAs per the census of 2002-03, about 61.18% of the area is under cultivation. The percentage of fallow land is 6.75%, compared to the corresponding figure for undivided Bihar prior to bifurcation, which was 42.77% and 16.02%, respectively. Following the creation of Jharkhand, forest area has dwindled to a meager 6.65% from 17.01%. The gross and net sown area in the state is 80.26 lakh ha and 56.38 lakh ha, respectively. The cropping intensity stands at 142%.\nOperational Holding\nAs 77% of the state’s main workforce is employed in the agriculture sector, the average size of operational holding in Bihar is only 0.75 ha, against the national average of 1.41 ha (Govt. of India, 2005). The share of marginal holdings (less than 1 ha each) is as much as 82.9%. Marginal and small holdings account for about 59.8% of the total operated area.\nCrop Production and Yield\nIn terms of the value of output of major crops in Bihar (Rs.3017) is a shade lower than that of all India (Rs.3576). Rice and wheat are the major crops of khar\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India divided by the river Ganga into North and South Bihar, with a significant agricultural economy and diverse river systems)##\n(\"entity\"<|>GANGA<|>GEO<|>A major river flowing through Bihar, dividing it into North and South regions and serving as a key water resource)##\n(\"entity\"<|>GHAGHRA<|>GEO<|>One of the 14 river basins in Bihar, contributing to the state's hydrological system)##\n(\"entity\"<|>GANDAK<|>GEO<|>A river basin in Bihar, part of the state's extensive river system)##\n(\"entity\"<|>BURHIGANDAK<|>GEO<|>Another river basin in Bihar, adding to the state's complex hydrological network)##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAGMATI<|>GEO<|>A river basin in Bihar, integral to the state's water resources and agricultural irrigation)##\n(\"entity\"<|>KAMLABALAN<|>GEO<|>A river basin in Bihar, contributing to the state's agricultural water supply)##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOSI<|>GEO<|>A significant river basin in Bihar, known for its changing courses and impact on agriculture)##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHANANDA<|>GEO<|>A river basin in Bihar, part of the state's network of rivers draining into the Ganga)##\n(\"entity\"<|>KARMNASA<|>GEO<|>A river system originating in Indian territory, affecting South Bihar's hydrology)##\n(\"entity\"<|>SONE<|>GEO<|>A river basin in Bihar, crucial for the region's agriculture and water management)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUNPUN<|>GEO<|>A river basin in Bihar, part of the state's extensive river system supporting agriculture)##\n(\"entity\"<|>KIUL-HARHAR<|>GEO<|>A river system in Bihar, contributing to the state's water resources)##\n(\"entity\"<|>BADUA<|>GEO<|>A river basin in Bihar, adding to the hydrological diversity of the state)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHANDAN<|>GEO<|>A river system in Bihar, part of the southern river systems originating from Indian territory)##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORTH BIHAR<|>GEO<|>The northern part of Bihar, characterized by its river systems originating in Tibet and Nepal, leading to frequent floods)##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTH BIHAR<|>GEO<|>The southern part of Bihar, with river systems primarily originating from Indian territories and contributing to the state's agriculture)##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZONE-I<|>GEO<|>North West Alluvial Plains, an agro-climatic zone in Bihar with specific soil and rainfall characteristics suitable for agriculture)##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZONE-II<|>GEO<|>North East Alluvial Plains, an agro-climatic zone in Bihar known for its streams and agricultural potential)##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZONE-III<|>GEO<|>South Bihar Alluvial Plains, an agro-climatic zone with medium to heavy textured soil, contributing to Bihar's agricultural productivity)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GANGA<|>NORTH BIHAR<|>The Ganga river divides Bihar into North and South, with North Bihar experiencing floods due to river systems originating in Tibet and Nepal<|>5)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GANGA<|>SOUTH BIHAR<|>The Ganga river divides Bihar into North and South, with South Bihar's river systems primarily originating from Indian territory<|>5)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NORTH BIHAR<|>ZONE-I<|>North Bihar includes the North West Alluvial Plains, known as Zone-I, suitable for agriculture<|>4)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NORTH BIHAR<|>ZONE-II<|>North Bihar includes the North East Alluvial Plains, known as Zone-II, with a landscape full of streams and agricultural land<|>4)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOUTH BIHAR<|>ZONE-III<|>South Bihar includes the South Bihar Alluvial Plains, known as Zone-III, with fertile soil for agriculture<|>4)<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
