During Covid-19, the facility of home delivery was started by the department to provide seeds to the farmers at their doorstep. A total quantity of 2.50 lakh quintal of seeds have been distributed among farmers through home delivery under various schemes during the third road map period. Under various schemes, quality seeds are being provided to the farmers through an App developed by BRBN. Reports related to seed distribution and details of beneficiary farmers are obtained through the online App.\nBrief Descriptions of DPR's Areas\n1.

Here is the reformatted section with proper headings, subheadings, and alignment:\n\n\n\nSources of Funds\nUpon approval of the Central Scheme of Sub-Mission on Seeds and Planting Material, the seed distribution program will be implemented. In seed distribution, the subsidy amount to the farmers will be the same as in the state scheme. The state share shall be provided in proportion to the central share received.\n\n\n\n1.2 Crop Diversification and Intensification\nIntroduction:\nThe prevalent cropping system of the state is Rice-Wheat based. The productivity of the rice-wheat cropping system in the state is low for several reasons. This cropping system is majorly affected by Climate Change attributes. In accordance with the priority of the development of Agriculture in the state, there is a need for diversification in the cropping system. It is also important to develop the cropping system as per the needs of the market. Crop diversification is expected to increase the income of farmers. To promote diversification, schemes such as Climate Resilient Agriculture Program, Oilseeds and Pulses Promotion Program, and Horticulture Development Programs are currently implemented in the state.\nUnder DPR of Crop Diversification and Intensification, the following components will be implemented:\n1. Millets Development Programme\n2. Jute Development Programme\n3. Aromatic and Medicinal Plant Promotion Programme\n4. Dryland Horticulture Crop Promotion Programme\n5. Flexi Fund for Promotion of Processing\n6. Research, Training, and Implementation of Micro-Irrigation\nKey Initiatives:\n* To promote crop diversification, a Centre of Excellence (COE) for millets will be established at Gaya. The COE will facilitate:\n   * Development of new varieties of millets as per the agro-climatic situation of the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
