Rice yields are highest in the southwestern districts, exceeding 2,500 kg/ha in Rohtas, Arwal, Aurangabad, Kaimur, and Bhojpur. Conversely, the lowest rice yields are observed in the northwest and southeast zones of the state.\nThese differences are primarily a function of climate and irrigation facilities. The southwest zone benefits from sufficient southwest monsoon showers, whereas the northern districts often face flood-like conditions. This is reflected in the low yields seen in flood-prone districts like Siwan and Gopalganj in the northwest zone. Additionally, rice yields are low in Bhagalpur, located in the southeast, which is prone to drought.\n\nChallenges of Floods and Droughts\nThe incidence of floods and droughts has been associated with significantly lower water productivity for rice in Bihar. Flood-prone areas are constrained by waterlogging and a poor drainage system, while drought-prone areas struggle with inadequate water conservation.\nIn this context, crop management practices, such as establishing and adhering to an optimum date for transplanting rice; adopting hybrid rice varieties that are of shorter duration and therefore less susceptible to drought; supplemental post-establishment irrigation; and/or direct seeding of rice, show promise for increasing rice yields. Examples of stress-tolerant, high-yield varieties include Swarna Sub 1 and Varshadhan for flood conditions, and Sahbhagidhan cultivars for drought conditions. Adequate supply of such improved cultivars will have to be ensured.\n\nIrrigation Infrastructure and Its Impact on Yields\nThe variations between agroclimatic zones are also influenced by the availability of irrigation infrastructure. The southwest accounts for nearly 30 percent of the gross irrigated area in the state, with a mix of canal and tube well irrigation. It also accounts for the greatest share of area under rice cultivation, which is irrigated.\nGains in rice yields in the lower and mid-Gangetic plains will depend on investment in infrastructure for rainwater harvesting and checking the overexploitation of groundwater. Such policies can positively impact yields by improving water productivity in the region.\n\nWheat Production Challenges and Solutions\nWheat production in Bihar is constrained by three critical factors:\nTemperature During Grain-Filling Period: High temperatures during this period reduce yields.\nApplication of Water and Nutrients: Insufficient water and nutrients lead to suboptimal growth.\nIncidence of Diseases: Diseases such as rusts and leaf blight adversely affect wheat production.\nThese factors have led to wheat yields in Bihar being half that of the Western Indo-Gangetic Plain (WIGP), despite similar potential based on soil properties.\nWheat Yield Variations\nThe highest wheat yields are found in the southwest (Rohtas, Bhojpur, Nalanda, and Patna) and northwest zones (Begusarai, Sitamarhi, and Samastipur). Conversely, the southeastern districts of Sheikhpura and Jamui have the lowest wheat yields in the state.\nAddressing Wheat Yield Gaps\nWheat crops in Bihar face heat stress due to shorter winters and the early onset of high temperatures. Additionally, late rice harvests delay wheat planting, exacerbating heat stress and leading to lower yields. This results in a yield gap of nearly 2.5 tons per hectare in the Eastern Indo-Gangetic Plain (EIGP).\nEarly Sowing: Early sowing with long-maturing varieties has been associated with a reduction in this yield gap. Surface Seeding & Zero-Tillage (ZT) Wheat: Techniques such as surface seeding of wheat in standing rice crops or sowing zero-till (ZT) wheat using ZT drills can prevent delays in sowing and associated heat stress.\nRole of Irrigation in Wheat Production\nThe northwest zone, which receives the highest amounts of winter rain in Bihar, supports higher wheat yields as the main rabi crop. Both the northwest and southwest zones have the largest shares of gross cropped area that is irrigated, with 35% and 30% of the state's irrigated area under wheat cultivation, respectively.\nGiven that two-thirds of wheat is grown under partial irrigation, improving irrigation infrastructure and access is crucial for boosting yields. Significant reductions in the yield gap in Bihar have been achieved with increased irrigation.\nFertilizer Use and Wheat Yield Improvement\nHigher rates of fertilizer application, particularly potassium, are associated with a 6.5 kg/ha reduction in the wheat yield gap in Bihar. Although fertilizer use is higher in the northern zones, most of the fertilizer used is nitrogen rather than phosphorus and potassium. Therefore, the priority of fertilizer policy should shift from nitrogen to potassium.\nIncreasing Cropping Intensity\nCropping Intensity Overview\nCropping intensity refers to the number of times the same land is cultivated each year, with three main cropping seasons in India: kharif (harvested in fall), rabi (harvested in winter), and zaid (harvested in summer). Farmers have the potential to cultivate land more than once per year.\nAccording to the Bihar Economic Survey (BES) for 2017–18, 56% of Bihar’s total geographical area was net sown, covering approximately 53 lakh hectares. The gross cropped area was about 75 lakh hectares, resulting in an average cropping intensity of 144%. Cropping intensity varies significantly across the state, with northern districts showing intensities between 1.65 and 2.24, while southern districts exhibit lower intensities of 1.6 or less.\nFactors Affecting Cropping Intensity\nThe lower cropping intensity in southern districts is partly due to water constraints, leading to post-kharif fallow periods. There is significant potential to increase cropping intensity by investing in traditional irrigation systems such as\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
