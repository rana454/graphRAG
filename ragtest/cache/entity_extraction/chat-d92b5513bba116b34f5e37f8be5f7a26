Among the districts of the north-west plains, the non-traditional chilli-growing districts showed higher yield than those in traditional chilli-growing districts. For example, it was high at 0.95 t/ha. in the non-traditional chilli-growing district of Gopalganj but low at 0.56 t/ha. in the traditional chilli-growing district of Samastipur.\nIV.10.13 Trend Rates of Growth in Yield\nZonewise analysis of the trend rates of growth in the yield of chilli clearly demonstrated that only the north-west alluvial plains (1.47%) had an increasing trend in yield during 1977-91. All other agro-climatic zones showed a declining trend. The rate of decline was as high as (-)5.15% per annum in the case of the east alluvial plains and (-)2.45% in the south-west alluvial plains. In the plateau districts, it declined annually at (-)1.94%. Between the two sub-periods, it showed an increasing trend in the first sub-period at 2.90% in the north-west alluvial plains, 0.07% in the east alluvial plains, and 4.22% in the plateau districts. However, the trend reversed to a declining rate in the second sub-period in all these zones at (-)3.78%, (-)11.00%, and (-)14.82% respectively. The south-west alluvial plains showed a declining trend in both the sub-periods at (-)1.90% and (-)2.30% respectively.\nIV.10.14 District Level Analysis\nAcross different districts, while the rate of growth in the yield of chilli was negative in most cases, there were districts that showed a high rate of growth during 1977-91. Such districts included:\nEast Champaran (6.20%)\nGopalganj (5.71%)\nSaran (6.04%)\nSiwan (6.21%)\nVaishali (10.21%)\nWest Champaran (6.10%)\nKatihar (5.92%)\nPurnea (5.19%)\nSaharsa (4.63%)\nHowever, none of these districts were dominant in chilli production.\n\nIV.10 CHILLIES\nThe crop group of spices and condiments grown in Bihar includes turmeric, coriander, chillies, ginger, and garlic. Chillies constituted a major share in terms of both area and production among these crops in Bihar. As much as 46.8% of the spices area and 47.8% of its production were under the chilli crop in the State in 1990-93. The following paragraphs examine the trend and pattern of growth in its production as well as area and yield over the years across different agro-climatic zones and districts in the State.\ni) Production\nThere was a sharp decline in chilli production in the state over these years. It was as high as 16.50 thousand tonnes in 1970-71, reaching a peak of 24.40 thousand tonnes in 1972-73. However, it started a nosedive thereafter, with the lowest level of production at 4.0 thousand tonnes in 1987-88. It, however, took an upward movement to reach 13.00 thousand tonnes in 1992-93. The trend rate of growth recorded a decline at (-)5.12% per annum during 1971-93. The rate of decline was (-)11.99% per annum in the second sub-period compared to (-)0.18% per annum in the first sub-period. The performance of the state in chilli production was poor compared to major chilli-growing states. For example, while Andhra Pradesh had a production of chilli at 320.67 thousand tonnes, it was only 7.90 thousand tonnes in Bihar in 1990-93. States like Karnataka, Maharashtra, Orissa, and Tamil Nadu were similarly much ahead of Bihar in chilli production. In terms of growth rate, it lagged far behind. In Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, and West Bengal, chilli production increased annually at 6.65%, 3.87%, and 8.92% respectively, but in Bihar, it declined annually at (-)5.31% during 1983-93.\nRegional Pattern\nAcross different zones, it was the east and the north-west plains that excelled in chilli production in the state. While the east plains had a share of 41.11% in the State chilli production, it was 34.46% for the north-west plains. Across different districts:\nBegusarai in the east plains and Rohtas in the south-west plains dominated in chilli production with shares of 32.35% and 21.84% respectively.\nOther districts that produced chilli significantly included:\nEast Champaran (2.64%)\nMuzaffarpur (2.65%)\nSamastipur (6.75%)\nVaishali (3.05%) in the north-west plains\nMuhger (1.04%) and Purnea (6.05%) in the east plains\nGaya (2.52%) and Patna (8.70%) in the south-west plains\nPalamu (2.87%) in the plateau zone\nThe declining trend in chilli production was recorded in all four agro-climatic zones. However, the zones in the north Gan\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
