It forms a single but heterogeneous aquifer system. Aquifers are available in abundance in both shallow and deep layers, capable of yielding good quantities of water, more so in latter cases. Marginal alluvial terrain is a low yield area, suitable for a series of open wells and small filter points. Such areas, however, are almost insignificant, restricted to Himalayan foothills of West Champaran district alone. Northern fringe of the alluvial tract near Himalayan foothills is, however, suitable for sinking of shallow heavy-duty tubewells and bamboo borings. Hard rock terrain, found in the plateau region, is best suited for large diameter open wells, as the yield of aquifer is low. The plateau region, particularly in the western side of the state, has soft rock areas, where ground water occurs in the weathered mantle and in the sandstones.\n\nTable 11-3\nGeological Succession Obtaining in Bihar\n\n11.10 Depth of water during the pre-monsoon period varies from 1.90m in Sahar block of Bhojpur district in the south-west alluvial plains and the sub-zone of the north-east alluvial to 22.03 m in Chakulia block of Singhbhum district in the sub-zone of the Eastern plateau. Post-monsoon water levels vary from 0.18 m in Sabour block of Bhagalpur district to 11.03m in Atra block of Gaya district.\n11.11 According to ground water resource evaluation, the state has been divided into nineteen sub-basins. They are:\nGanga\nGandak\nBurhi Gandak\nBagmati-Adhawara\nKamla\nKosi\nMahananda\nKarmnasa\nSone and North Koel\nPunpun\nKiul and Harohar\nBadka\nChandan\nChir\nGamai\nSankh\nSouth Koel\nDamodar\nSubarnarekha\n\nv) Soils\n11.12 Broadly, there are six soil groups found in the state. They are:\ni) Recent alluvium\nii) Young alluvium\niii) Old alluvium\niv) Sub-Himalayan and forest\nv) Red and yellow\nvi) Tal land\n11.13 The entire range of plains, both in the north and south Bihar, has an alluvial tract. But the plateau region has red and yellow soils. In some parts of the plateau, black forest soils are also found. Fertility of these soils is not comparable to the one found in the plains of Bihar. The last category of land, i.e., Tal land, is found in the back-waters of the Ganges and Sone rivers, where land remains inundated during the kharif season, and it is available for sowing only during the rabi season. It is fertile and rich but prone to pest and disease.\n\nvi) Flood Prone and Tal Areas\n11.14 A fairly large chunk of area (19.7%) in the state is flood-prone. It is as high as 54.1% and 51.8% in the north-west and east alluvial plains respectively. Districts prone to flood are identified as East Champaran, West Champaran, Sitamarhi, Madhubani, Begusarai, Saharsa, Purnea, and Katihar. Sources of flood could be seen in the flowing of a large number of flood-prone rivers through the states, emanating largely from the neighboring Himalayan kingdom of Nepal and even the north-west hinterlands of the country. Prominent of such rivers include Ganga, Gandak, Burhi Gandak, Bagmati, Adhwara, Kamla, Kosi, Mahananda, and Punpun. Besides, there is a large chunk of low-lying areas around the river of Ganga flowing through such districts as Patna, Begusarai, Khagaria, and Bhagalpur, inundated by flood waters to recede only after December-January. This is known as Tal area. The problem of this area is distinct which needs specific treatment suitable to their conditions.\n\nvii) Drought Prone Areas\n11.15 A sufficiently large part (50.2%) of the state is drought-prone. It is as high as 86.1% in the plateau region and 72.4% in the eastern plains. In the south-west plains, around one-fourth is drought-prone. Such districts include Bhagalpur and Munger in the eastern plains, Rohtas in the south-west plains, and Dhanbad, Santhal Parganas, Singhbhum, Giridih, Palamu, and Ranchi in the plateau region.\n\nviii) Population\n11.16 Bihar was second only to Uttar Pradesh in terms of the size of human resources with a population of 864 lakh persons in 1991, growing annually at 2.1%, which was a little lower than the national average of 2.2%. Significantly, there was a reversal in the increasing rate of population growth in the State since the eighties. It was projected at 940 lakh persons for 1995. It had a share of 10.21% of the country's population. Density of population was high at 497 persons per sq. km., only next to West Bengal (767 persons\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India with diverse geological and hydrological features, including alluvial basins, hard and soft rock terrains, and significant agricultural and flood-prone areas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GANGA<|>GEO<|>Major river flowing through Bihar, contributing to the state's alluvial plains and flood-prone areas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GANDAK<|>GEO<|>A river in Bihar, identified as one of the sub-basins for ground water resource evaluation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BURHI GANDAK<|>GEO<|>A river in Bihar, part of the state's nineteen sub-basins for ground water resource evaluation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAGMATI-ADHAWARA<|>GEO<|>River system in Bihar, included in the state's sub-basins for ground water resource evaluation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOSI<|>GEO<|>A river in Bihar, known for its shifting course and contributing to the flood-prone areas of the state)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHANANDA<|>GEO<|>A river in Bihar, part of the ground water resource evaluation's sub-basins)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SONE AND NORTH KOEL<|>GEO<|>Rivers in Bihar, included in the ground water resource evaluation's sub-basins)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAMODAR<|>GEO<|>A river in Bihar, part of the state's sub-basins for ground water resource evaluation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUBARNAREKHA<|>GEO<|>A river in Bihar, included in the ground water resource evaluation's sub-basins)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EAST CHAMPARAN<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar identified as flood-prone)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEST CHAMPARAN<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar identified as flood-prone)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SITAMARHI<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar identified as flood-prone)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MADHUBANI<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar identified as flood-prone)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEGUSARAI<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar identified as flood-prone)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAHARSA<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar identified as flood-prone)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PURNIA<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar identified as flood-prone)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KATIHAR<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar identified as flood-prone)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GANGA<|>BIHAR<|>The Ganga river flows through Bihar, significantly influencing its geography and hydrology<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EAST CHAMPARAN<|>GANGA<|>East Champaran is a district in Bihar prone to flooding, partly due to the Ganga river<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WEST CHAMPARAN<|>GANGA<|>West Champaran is a district in Bihar prone to flooding, influenced by the Ganga river<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KOSI<|>BIHAR<|>The Kosi river, known for its shifting courses, contributes to the flood-prone nature of Bihar<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAHARSA<|>KOSI<|>Saharsa district is prone to flooding, which is influenced by the Kosi river's behavior<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PURNIA<|>MAHANANDA<|>Purnia district is affected by the Mahananda river, contributing to its flood-prone status<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
