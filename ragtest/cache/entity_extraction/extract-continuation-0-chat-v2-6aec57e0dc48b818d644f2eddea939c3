In all other districts, it was less than 10.07% of the net sown area. The level of irrigation showed shrinkage in all the districts ranging between (-)12.15% as in Dhanbad and (-)0.77% as in Ranchi during 1977-91.\nCanal\nIX.7 Canal irrigation showed an increasing trend only in respect of the east plains (2.12%) and the south-west plains (1.35%). The rate of increase in canal irrigation was impressive, especially in Aurangabad (4.52%), Saharsa (3.05%), Munger (2.89%), and Bhagalpur (2.08%). All these districts showed relatively high levels of irrigation from the canal. There were a few other districts as well with high canal irrigation networks, but showing shrinkage therein. They included East Champaran (-1.13%), Gopalganj (-3.71%), and West Champaran (-4.86%). Districts of the plateau zone also showed a decline in canal irrigation, prominently in Santhal Parganas (-9.35%). By implication, there was a decline of 1.04 lakh hectares in canal irrigation in the State over these years, which formed 9.50% of canal irrigation in 1990-91. This means, irrigation potentials on these lands were created, but irrigation could not be provided because of choking of canals or absence of proper distribution or land falling at the tail-end unable to receive irrigation. Improvement in terms of desiltation of canals, repair of bunds, and creation of additional distributories may enable irrigation on these lands as well.\nIX.8 Tubewell irrigation, the other major source of irrigation, showed expansion in respect of the north-west (3.10%), the east (3.52%), and the south-west plains (0.98%). The plateau districts, on the other hand, showed shrinkage (-0.13%) in tubewell irrigation. The districts showing impressive expansion in tubewell irrigation included Darbhanga (4.35%), Madhubani (4.59%), Vaishali (5.28%), and West Champaran (6.35%) in the north-west plains; Begusarai (6.33%) and Purnea (6.95%) in the east plains; Nawadah (3.73%) in the south-west plains; and Hazaribagh (8.61%) in the plateau. Districts such as Muzaffarpur, Munger, Aurangabad, and Rohtas, where tubewell irrigation was prominent, however, showed shrinkage in tubewell irrigation. The aggregate decline in tubewell irrigation area in the State came to 0.49 lakh hectares. The major reason for the decline in tubewell irrigation could be attributed to non-functioning of the state-owned deep tubewells. Besides, some of the private investment in shallow tubewells have become unviable.\nIX.9 Irrigation through other wells was not a major source at the aggregate level. However, in some of the districts, especially in the plateau zone, it was an important source with a larger share in total irrigation. Such districts included Gopalganj, Saran, and Siwan in the north-west; Bhagalpur and Munger in the east; Gaya and Nalanda in the south-west; and Santhal Parganas, Giridih, Hazaribagh, Palamu, and Ranchi in the plateau zone. In all these districts, except Bhagalpur, irrigation through other wells showed a decline. The rate of decline was significantly high in respect of Saran, Siwan, Nalanda, and Nawadah. Aggregate decline in irrigation through other wells in 1990-91 over 1976-77 worked out to 1.62 lakh hectares, which formed 124.53% of the irrigation through other wells in 1990-91. Irrigation potential through other wells created once, but were lying unutilized for reasons of energisation, incomplete channel work, etc.\nIX.10 Irrigation through ponds/tanks, though in small magnitude, is uniformly spread in different agro-climatic zones of the State and showed almost stagnant area under their irrigation at the state level. Across different districts, however, while it showed impressive increases in respect of districts such as Darbhanga, Madhubani, West Champaran, Munger, Gaya, Nalanda, and Hazaribagh, a few other districts registered sharp declines in area under pond/tank irrigation. They included Samastipur, Siwan, Santhal Parganas, Giridih, and Palamu. Aggregate decline in irrigation through ponds/tanks worked out to 0.38 lakh hectares, which formed 33.10% of ponds/tanks irrigated area in 1990-91 in the state.\n(ii) Irrigation Intensity\nIX.11 Irrigation intensity, measured as the ratio of gross irrigated area to net irrigated area, provides one measure to examine the extent of irrigation utilization. Analysis of the data suggests that it was quite low at 124.0% for the State in 1991-92 as against 180.0% in Punjab, 163.0% in Haryana, and 148.0% in Uttar Pradesh. A district-wise analysis shows that while the south-west plains had higher irrigation intensity at 158.14%, the east plains had relatively lower intensity at 119.62% and the plateau districts had the least irrigation intensity at 79.94%. The irrigation intensity showed an increasing trend in the south-west plains (0.66% p.a.), while it was declining in all other agro-climatic zones.\n(iii) The\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DHANBAD<|>GEO<|>A district that experienced a significant shrinkage in irrigation levels between 1977-91, with a decrease of 12.15%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RANCHI<|>GEO<|>A district with the least shrinkage in irrigation levels during 1977-91, showing a decrease of 0.77%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AURANGABAD<|>GEO<|>A district with an impressive increase in canal irrigation by 4.52%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAHARSA<|>GEO<|>A district that showed a significant increase in canal irrigation by 3.05%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUNGER<|>GEO<|>A district with a notable increase in canal irrigation by 2.89%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BHAGALPUR<|>GEO<|>A district that experienced an increase in canal irrigation by 2.08%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EAST CHAMPARAN<|>GEO<|>A district that showed shrinkage in canal irrigation by -1.13%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOPALGANJ<|>GEO<|>A district with a significant decline in canal irrigation by -3.71%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEST CHAMPARAN<|>GEO<|>A district that experienced a major decline in canal irrigation by -4.86%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SANTHAL PARGANAS<|>GEO<|>A plateau zone district with a prominent decline in canal irrigation by -9.35%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DARBHANGA<|>GEO<|>A district in the north-west plains with an impressive expansion in tubewell irrigation by 4.35%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MADHUBANI<|>GEO<|>A district in the north-west plains with a significant increase in tubewell irrigation by 4.59%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VAISHALI<|>GEO<|>A district in the north-west plains with a notable increase in tubewell irrigation by 5.28%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEGUSARAI<|>GEO<|>A district in the east plains with a substantial increase in tubewell irrigation by 6.33%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PURNEA<|>GEO<|>A district in the east plains with the highest increase in tubewell irrigation by 6.95%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAWADAH<|>GEO<|>A district in the south-west plains with a significant increase in tubewell irrigation by 3.73%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAZARIBAGH<|>GEO<|>A plateau district with the highest increase in tubewell irrigation by 8.61%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUZAFFARPUR<|>GEO<|>A district where tubewell irrigation was prominent but showed shrinkage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROHTAS<|>GEO<|>A district that experienced shrinkage in tubewell irrigation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SARAN<|>GEO<|>A district in the north-west; saw a significant decline in irrigation through other wells)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIWAN<|>GEO<|>A district in the north-west; experienced a high rate of decline in irrigation through other wells)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NALANDA<|>GEO<|>A district in the south-west; showed a significant decline in irrigation through other wells)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAYA<|>GEO<|>A district in the south-west; part of the districts with an increase in pond/tank irrigation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMASTIPUR<|>GEO<|>A district that registered a sharp decline in area under pond/tank irrigation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GIRIDIH<|>GEO<|>A district that saw a sharp decline in area under pond/tank irrigation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PALAMU<|>GEO<|>A district with a notable decline in area under pond/tank irrigation)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
