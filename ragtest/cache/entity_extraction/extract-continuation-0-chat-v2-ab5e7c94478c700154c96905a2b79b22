Greater focus on increasing productivity of the livestock economy is essential for meeting the rising demand for livestock products and enhancing nutrition, while also ensuring greater rural incomes.\n\nProduction of Milk in Bihar\nIncrease in Milk Production\nProduction of milk in Bihar increased from 2.7 to 7.2 million metric tons between 2001–2 and 2013–14; however, milk productivity continues to lag behind other major milk-producing states in the country, such as Gujarat and Punjab.\nConstraints to Milk Productivity\nLower productivity of milk is attributed to inadequate usage of superior breed germplasm in the state. Lack of skilled manpower, deficiencies in animal health services, and limited availability of fodder are the other major constraints for livestock development in Bihar. The productive potential of animals depends crucially on the quality of nutrition, genetic material, and health status.\nCurrent Situation and Policy Initiatives\nCurrently, only one semen production center exists in the state for a total of 4,500 cattle-breeding centers, highlighting the supply and demand mismatch for cattle breeding in the state (Hoda, Rajkhowa and Gulati, 2017). Recent policy initiatives emphasizing the rearing of indigenous varieties of buffalo, procurement of pedigreed bulls of higher genetic potential, and investments to set up a new frozen semen center are strong indicators of a positive ecosystem that is being created for this sector. Sustaining the momentum through strengthened collaboration between the state government, nationally recognized animal breeding research centers, and the private sector is warranted for overall genetic improvement of the livestock.\nNeed for Infrastructure and Mapping\nThere is also a need to undertake a mapping of preferred breeds of animals owned by farmers in the different regions in the state. Inadequacies of infrastructure (such as veterinary hospitals or diagnostic labs) in the state further constrain the delivery of animal health services. Lack of laboratories and trained veterinarian staff affect prompt diagnosis of zoonotic diseases, thereby contributing to higher livestock mortality. Currently, the state has around 1,153 veterinary hospitals/dispensaries to cater to the needs of a livestock population of about 32.9 million (DoES). Non-availability of cold chains in the state is yet another constraint for enhancing the coverage of artificial insemination (AI) services and prevents timely delivery of health services related to deworming and vaccination of livestock. Provision of enough fodder for livestock is another problem; due to pressure on land for both agriculture and non-agricultural uses, grazing land has been gradually diminishing (DoAHDF, 2017). Production of fodder on the riverbanks, when the river water recedes, has the potential for greater fodder production.\nIncreasing Farmers’ Incomes through Value Chains\nImportance of Processing and Value Addition\nAdequate attention to processing and value addition is important to minimize postharvest losses, increase shelf life, and retain nutritive content of food products. Vegetables contribute to about 30 percent of the total agricultural production in Bihar, but government marketing facilities are limited largely to procurement of rice and wheat. Even in the case of rice, less than 20 percent of the total produce is sold through the government procurement channels (Hoda, Rajkhowa and Gulati, 2017). High levels of poverty among farmers could be a reflection of poor state support for agricultural marketing (Chand, 2017).\nImpact of APMC Act Repeal\nRepeal of the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act and complete deregulation since 2006 in Bihar has failed to trigger private investments, either in developing new market infrastructure or in the expansion of area under contract farming. Farmers were forced to sell most of the crops in unregulated agricultural markets, limiting true price discovery. Deregulation resulted in the decline of farm harvest prices, with a disproportionately greater loss for poorer farmers with smaller capital endowments. From a policy perspective, large-scale investments (public and private) are required to set up newer markets, along with an upgradation of the existing marketing yards and improvements in infrastructure and equipment. Development of rural roads, extension of phone networks, and establishment of market information centers are among other measures for better price realization.\nPromotion of Aggregation Models\nThere is a strong need for policies to promote aggregation models in the form of Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), especially among small farmers to integrate them into modern value chains. Creation of an agribusiness model in collaboration with FPOs would go a long way in linking up smallholders with retailers and can play a role in ensuring regular supplies. The state government should look for ways to make these aggregation models more sustainable by incentivizing and supporting the system. These federations should be empowered with greater managerial skills for efficient and smooth functioning.\nAgro Processing and Value Addition\nThe success of makhana (Fox Nut/Lotus seed) as a food product from Bihar is an outcome of its linkages to national and international markets, as well as the availability of a good quality surplus produce that can be used for value addition. For most other crops produced in the state, agro processing and value addition take place outside of Bihar. For primary producers to benefit from such value addition, growth of agro processing units need to be incentivized. While there has been an increase in private investment in agro processing facilities in Bihar, it is still restricted to value addition for staple crops. Bihar Agriculture Roadmap 2012–17 calls for active state intervention by way of creating “Common Facility Centres” for certification, warehousing, transportation, and sale of outputs. The Central Food Processing Policy of 2007 (unfortunately discontinued in 2012) that incentivized private investments in the state may require a fresh look under the emerging circumstances to attract private investments in the agro processing sector in Bihar.\n\nPolicy Recommendations\nDiversification of Food Systems\nPolicymakers need\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India focusing on increasing livestock productivity and milk production to enhance rural incomes and nutrition)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GUJARAT<|>GEO<|>A major milk-producing state in India, mentioned as having higher milk productivity compared to Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUNJAB<|>GEO<|>Another major milk-producing state in India with higher milk productivity compared to Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEMIN PRODUCTION CENTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The only center in Bihar for semen production, indicating a supply and demand mismatch for cattle breeding)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FARMER PRODUCER ORGANIZATIONS (FPOS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Organizations aimed at integrating small farmers into modern value chains and ensuring regular supplies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SELF-HELP GROUPS (SHGS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Groups promoting aggregation models among small farmers to integrate them into modern value chains)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>SEMIN PRODUCTION CENTER<|>Bihar hosts only one semen production center for cattle breeding, highlighting a supply-demand mismatch<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>GUJARAT<|>Bihar is compared to Gujarat in terms of milk productivity, with Gujarat having higher productivity<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>PUNJAB<|>Bihar is compared to Punjab in terms of milk productivity, with Punjab having higher productivity<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FARMER PRODUCER ORGANIZATIONS (FPOS)<|>BIHAR<|>FPOs play a significant role in Bihar's agricultural sector by linking smallholders with markets<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SELF-HELP GROUPS (SHGS)<|>BIHAR<|>SHGs support small farmers in Bihar to integrate into modern value chains<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
