For this study, 31 districts as they existed in 1973-74 were considered, as the required data at the district level was uniformly available for these districts for the period under reference.\nd) Selection of Crops\n\n8 Study of Major Crops\nIn addition to studying foodgrain production as such, a detailed study was also attempted for specific major crops. Major crops were defined following different criteria for different crop groups to give proper representation to these groups in the present study.\na) Cereal Crops\nAll cereal crops having a cropped area exceeding one lakh hectares were included. This led to the identification of paddy, maize, and wheat as major crops in the State.\nb) Pulses\nData were available in respect of arhar and gram alone. Therefore, these crops alone among the pulses were considered.\nc) Oilseeds\nProduction of oilseeds is fairly high in the state. Prominent among them are rapeseed/mustard, linseed, nigerseed, sunflower seed, etc. As rapeseed/mustard occupied almost 50% of the oilseeds area, only this crop has been selected for detailed study.\nd) Fiber Crops\nJute, being the single most important fiber crop, is also included as a major crop.\ne) Spices\nAmong spice crops, the State figured prominently in respect of chillies, turmeric, coriander, and garlic. From among these crops, only chilli is considered, as it occupied the maximum area (around 60%) among spice crops.\nf) Non-Foodgrain Crops\nSugarcane and potato are the other non-foodgrain crops considered as major crops for the present study, as they covered relatively large areas at 142.2 and 167.23 thousand hectares respectively in 1990-93.\ng) Beverage and Narcotics Crops\nAmong the beverage and narcotics crops, tobacco with 15.6 thousand hectares under its cultivation was the only crop which could be considered a major crop.\nThus, the major crops identified for detailed study include:\nFoodgrain Crops: paddy, maize, wheat, arhar, and gram\nNon-Foodgrain Crops: rapeseed/mustard, sugarcane, jute, potato, chillies, and tobacco\nThese crops constituted 86.53% of the gross cultivated area in the state.\n1.9 Analysis of Growth Rates\nPerformance of agriculture was examined in terms of compound annual rate of growth (CARG) in area, production, and yield of foodgrains as well as major crops during the period under reference. As explained earlier, it was obtained for the total period under reference as well as for two sub-periods separately to comprehend the growth performance in recent years in particular. Exponential trend function was used to estimate the compound annual rate of growth. Inherently, it assumes that the compound growth rate is constant over time and the growth is a continuous phenomenon.\nThe exponential trend equation takes the following form: Y=AebtY = Ae^{bt}Y=Aebt i.e., log⁡Y=log⁡A+bt\\log Y = \\log A + btlogY=logA+bt\nwhere YYY = Area, production, and yield of a crop in year ttt (three-year moving average has been taken for netting out the seasonal and other fluctuations), AAA is a constant and bbb value in this equation expresses the rate of change and when multiplied by 100 gives the percentage growth rate.\n1.10 Acceleration/Deceleration of Growth Rates\nA semi-log quadratic function of the form: log⁡Y=a+bt+ct2\\log Y = a + bt + ct^2logY=a+bt+ct2 was used to study the behavior of trends in growth rates. The sign of ccc in this equation conveys whether the trend is accelerating or decelerating with time.\n1.11 Measure of Instability\nVariability in the annual growth rates provides a measure of the degree of instability in production over the specified period. In the present case, departure from the trend line has been considered a measure of instability. Accordingly, the de-trended coefficient of variation was worked out for the production data series of different crops in different districts/zones using the following formula: CV=Standard DeviationMean×100\\text{CV} = \\frac{\\text{Standard Deviation}}{\\text{Mean}} \\times 100CV=MeanStandard Deviation​×100\n1.12 Valuation of Agricultural Output\nPerformance of agriculture was also measured in terms of compound annual rate of growth in the value of agricultural output during 1977-91 at the state/zone/district level. The value of agricultural output was obtained by considering 25 food as well as non-food crops, which constituted around 98.0% of the total cropped area in the state. Using 1980-81 prices of respective crops at the state level, the physical production of these crops was valued and added up to arrive at the aggregate value of agricultural output. On this basis, the compound annual rate of growth was worked out separately for food and non-food crops as well as the aggregate of agricultural output at the state/zone/district level for the total period under reference as well as for the two sub-periods.\n1.13 Multiple Regression\nTo determine the influence of specified parameters on the value of agricultural output per hectare, the multiple regression technique was used in the following form: Y=a+b1X1+b2X2+b3X3+b4X4+eY = a + b_1X_1 + b_2\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
