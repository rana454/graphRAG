Though certain positive initiatives have been taken by the government in the form of the Bihar Fish Jalkar Management Act 2006 for short and long term leasing of these community water bodies, it needs effective implementation at Gram Panchayat levels. Community approach for integrated development shall aid in the development of aquaculture in these ponds.\n(i) For the development of the inland waters, fishing rights must be with the State Fisheries Department. The lease amount should be rationalized with lease duration of 12 years or more and lease rent fixed according to productivity and level of multiple uses. Specific policies should be framed to lease out different sized ponds to fishermen cooperatives, group of fishers or individual fisherman, SHGs, private entrepreneurs in order to have efficient aquaculture management to exploit its full production potential. In addition to this, fisheries graduates can be given preference for taking the pond on lease.\n(ii) The policy for promotion and development of aquaculture in the State would include:\n(a) Tariff realization in order to give parity with agriculture sector\n(b) More vibrant FFDAs\n(c) Self-sufficiency in quality and disease-free seed and feed\n(d) A suitable legal framework\nThe strategy would include:\n(a) Scientific stocking\n(b) Horizontal expansion of farming area\n(c) Integrated farming\n(d) Contract farming\n(e) Species diversification\n(f) Transfer of departmental fish farm to private entrepreneurs\n(g) Development of approach road to aquaculture clusters\n(h) Empowerment of farmers and fisherwomen and utilization of technical expertise of fisheries graduates\n(i) Increase in productivity\n234. The main strategy for the future should be the vertical expansion, i.e., improving the production of the existing extensive and semi-intensive area, and horizontal expansion, i.e., bringing unutilized cultivable area under scientific extensive/semi-intensive farming and creation of new ponds for aquaculture in the State. In the next fifteen years in a phased manner, the entire existing potential freshwater aquaculture resources would be brought under extensive and semi-intensive fish farming with an average production level of 5 tonnes/ha/annum. This would have far-reaching implications for the future of the Fisheries Sector.\nTraining and Extension Needs\n235. Since training and improvement of culture and fishing skills are highly useful, the Government should take a lead role in organizing training and dissemination camps for imparting latest knowledge and technology to fish farmers and fishery entrepreneurs, with the help and active participation of Central Government Organizations like ICAR Institutes such as CIFE, Mumbai and College of Fisheries of RAU in different aspects of fisheries and aquaculture. Even the training of officers and staff of the Department of Fisheries of the State through refresher courses, trainers training programmes, etc., would go a long way in strengthening and empowering of Government machinery through latest technologies in various aspects of fisheries and aquaculture. Through these interventions, the total fish production per year in Bihar can be increased to about 4.5 lakh tonnes, making the state self-sufficient in fisheries and a possible supply to national markets on the pattern of Andhra Pradesh.\nChapter 11: Implications of Proposed Strategy\n236. There are far-reaching implications of the strategy and policy as well as institutional direction proposed in this Report. One of the major implications is a vast financial requirement to implement the proposals during the next 5 – 6 years (2008-09 to 2012-13) against the current plan allocation of Rs.1,698 crores (in the 11th Five Year Plan). Total required outlay for this period is estimated at Rs.27,055 crores. (See Annexure-XXXIX for details). This level of outlays is fully justified to make Bihar the ‘Granary’ of India and a major hub of fruits and vegetables for both national and international markets. Recent field study sponsored by the Task Force (through APEDA) has revealed that Bihar has the capability to produce market expected products of fruits (including honey) and vegetables and there is already a demand for such products in U.K., Middle East, and Mauritius. Another major expected impact is on Bihari farmers’ income, employment, and general living standards.\n237. Once agriculture gets revamped, income shall flow to villagers ensuring livelihood security, employment, and empowerment of women. It is expected that productivity of rice, wheat, maize, pulses, oilseeds, sugarcane would increase from 1.5 t/ha to 3.1 t/ha, 2.1 t/ha to 3.1 t/ha, 2.7 t/ha to 4.5 t/ha, 7.3 t/ha to 11.1 t/ha, 1.1 to 1.4 t/ha and 45.5 t/ha to 70.5 t/ha, respectively. The recent level of productivity of rice and wheat is shown in Annexure-XL. Productivity of fruits and vegetables shall increase from the current level of 11.0 t/ha to 15 t/ha and 16.5 to 20.0 t/ha. New area of floricultures, medicinal and aromatic plants, and spices shall be appropriately harnessed. Waste land could be effectively utilized and the state shall emerge as the largest producer of honey and organic produce. The general assessment is that current farm productivity level in Bihar is low in comparison to its potential. Therefore, in order to fully exploit the potential, there would be a need for much higher financial resources.\n238. Although Bihar has established a good network for dairy, the health of animals continues to be poor and there is a lot of potential for improvements in animal health and thus scope for addition in animal products and value addition in milk. Similarly, huge water bodies are not appropriately utilized.
