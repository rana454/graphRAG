This intervention aimed at increasing the availability and accessibility of nutritious foods for smallholder farming households.\nSMART Model Trials\nTARINA introduced the Sustainable Multi-species Agricultural Resources Model Trials (SMART) in Bihar. SMART develops mixed, sequential cropping models for farmers with small and marginal landholdings for the intensification of their production. Key features include:\nCultivation of mixed crops of maize and pulses, or oilseeds and pulses.\nIntegration of pulses and vegetables into existing cropping systems.\nTo create an enabling environment and pathway for increased adoption of nonstaples, an integrated approach of providing technical inputs and capacity-building interventions has been used. The availability and accessibility of quality seeds played a major role in encouraging farmers to cultivate different varieties of pulses and vegetables, depending on their diet preferences and market demands.\nCommunity Involvement\nIn Bihar, this intervention has relied on leveraging existing community platforms, like self-help groups and other interest groups, to promote crop diversification, especially among women farmers. This intervention directly relates to:\nSDG2.1: Ensuring access to nutritious foods\nSDG2.3: Focus on women\nImpact\nIn 2016–19, there has been an increase in the number of households that have diversified their production systems, reflected in both an increase in area under nonstaples and an increase in the average number of crops cultivated (production diversity score). The diversified production also translated to increased consumption diversity.\n\nMaize Production in Bihar\nIn addition to rice and wheat, the other major food crop grown in Bihar is maize. It accounts for 20 percent of the total food grain output in the state. Bihar is the third largest producer of maize in the country. Farmers choose to substitute paddy with maize, given its increasing importance as a commercial crop, to meet the demands of the food processing industry and its use as poultry feed. Bihar has a special advantage with respect to maize production: unlike most other states, it produces maize in the rabi season. This means that maize from Bihar fills a demand from processing units during this time—a demand that originates largely from the growing poultry industry. The share of area under maize cultivation has marginally increased over the last few years from 7.6 percent in 2002–03 to 9.3 percent in 2016–17. As of 2018–19, a little over 10 percent of the area under cultivation was being used for maize. The northern districts account for 75 percent of the area under cultivation and output from maize cultivation in the state.\nRisks in Maize Cultivation\nMaize cultivation faces three risks in Bihar: inputs, prices, and yields. One of the important inputs of production is access to irrigation. The northern districts where maize cultivation is concentrated face flood-like conditions during the monsoon season. Nearly two-thirds of the area under maize cultivation in Bihar is irrigated and is within the northwest and northeast agroclimatic zones. Maize is, however, less water intensive than rice and wheat, a characteristic that allows it to be relatively more resilient at times of water stress.\nMaize yields in Bihar are below the yields at the national level and lower than those in states like Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal. Since the northeast zone’s share of production is greater than its share of area, maize yields are expected to be highest there; this can be seen in districts like Purnea, Araria, Supaul, and Katihar, where yields were in excess of 7,000 kg/ha in 2018. These yields are significantly higher than the state average of 4,700 kg/ha. One of the main inputs that is associated with yields of maize in Bihar is the use of hybrid varieties, in particular single-cross hybrids (SCBs). Yield improvements can occur as efforts are stepped up to promote the adoption of hybrid maize, particularly in the rainy season in districts where such adoption is low. In flood-prone districts where adoption is poor, maize cultivation can be carried out on raised beds and ridges that reduce the risks associated with excessive water. Concurrently, seed supply chains need to be strengthened to ensure timely availability of hybrid seeds.\nFruits and Vegetables\nImportance\nHorticultural products like fruits and vegetables offer a source of diversification of income for farming households and are important contributors to nutritional security in the state. Bihar accounts for about 5 percent of total fruit production in India and slightly less than 10 percent of the vegetable production. The government’s emphasis on horticulture is evident in the latest agricultural roadmap that focuses on organic cultivation under the Bihar State Organic Mission (which has a dual objective of sustainable farming and increased incomes) and rooftop cultivation, as part of the Chief Minister’s Horticulture Mission. Yet, even though the productivity of land is higher for horticultural crops, compared to cereals, the overall level of diversification is low in Bihar, as reflected by the fact that rice, wheat, and maize continue to account for 80 percent of gross cropped area.\nRecent Trends\nBoth the area and production of fruits and vegetables in Bihar have increased over the 3-year period from 2016–19. Fruits and vegetables accounted for approximately 6 percent of the cropped area and 40 percent of the total value of output. Despite adequate irrigation and a change in consumption demand toward these products, the increase in the area under cultivation of fruits and vegetables has been slow. The average yield for fruits has remained constant at 14 tons per hectare over 2016–18, slightly below the all-India yield of 15 tons per hectare. For the same period, the growth in productivity for vegetables has been greater in the state, increasing from 17.4 tons per hectare in 2016 to 19\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MUNGER DISTRICT<|>GEO<|>Location in Bihar focused on diversifying production systems by cultivating vegetables, pulses, and oilseeds to increase availability and accessibility of nutritious foods for smallholder farming households)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SMART MODEL TRIALS<|>EVENT<|>Sustainable Multi-species Agricultural Resources Model Trials introduced in Bihar to develop mixed, sequential cropping models for small and marginal landholders, focusing on the cultivation of maize, pulses, oilseeds, and integration of pulses and vegetables into existing systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>State in India where SMART Model Trials are conducted, known for its diversification in agriculture, including maize production, and facing challenges in maize cultivation due to risks in inputs, prices, and yields)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SDG2.1<|>EVENT<|>Sustainable Development Goal focused on ensuring access to nutritious foods, related to the interventions in Bihar for crop diversification)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SDG2.3<|>EVENT<|>Sustainable Development Goal with a focus on women, related to the interventions in Bihar promoting crop diversification among women farmers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAIZE PRODUCTION<|>EVENT<|>Significant agricultural activity in Bihar, with the state being the third largest producer of maize in India, contributing to the food processing industry and poultry feed)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR STATE ORGANIC MISSION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Government initiative focusing on organic cultivation and sustainable farming to increase incomes and promote horticulture in Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHIEF MINISTER’S HORTICULTURE MISSION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Government initiative under the leadership of the Chief Minister to promote rooftop cultivation and enhance horticultural production in Bihar)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SMART MODEL TRIALS<|>BIHAR<|>SMART Model Trials were introduced in Bihar to enhance agricultural productivity and sustainability<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MUNGER DISTRICT<|>BIHAR<|>Munger District is located in Bihar, focusing on agricultural diversification<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SDG2.1<|>BIHAR<|>The interventions in Bihar aim to achieve SDG2.1 by ensuring access to nutritious foods through agricultural diversification<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SDG2.3<|>BIHAR<|>The interventions in Bihar, especially among women farmers, are aligned with achieving SDG2.3<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAIZE PRODUCTION<|>BIHAR<|>Maize production is a significant part of Bihar's agricultural output, making it the third largest producer in India<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR STATE ORGANIC MISSION<|>BIHAR<|>The Bihar State Organic Mission is a government initiative aimed at promoting organic cultivation within the state<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHIEF MINISTER’S HORTICULTURE MISSION<|>BIHAR<|>Initiative led by the Chief Minister to enhance horticultural production in Bihar<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
