Districts of the south-west alluvial plains, on the contrary, showed uniformity in the expansion of area sown more than once, increasing in the range of 1.89% as in Nalanda and 1.29% as in Gaya. The scenario among the districts of the plateau zone was different with some of the districts showing a high rate of decline. The rate of decline was as high as (-)9.22% in Santhal Parganas and (-)2.03% in Dhanbad. Districts such as Singhbhum, Hazaribagh, Palamu, and Ranchi, however, showed an increasing trend in area sown more than once at 6.21%, 1.90%, and 1.61% respectively.\ne) Gross Cropped Area\nVII.12 In the context of expanding area sown more than once, gross cropped area showed shrinkage in most of the agro-climatic zones and districts. All the zones of the north-west alluvial plains, south-west alluvial plains, east alluvial plains, and plateau districts showed a declining trend in gross cropped area at (-)0.62%, (-)0.45%, (-)0.15%, and (-)2.31% respectively. The declining trend was far and wide among the districts of the north-west, in the range of (-)1.83% as in Sitamarhi and (-)0.03% as in Siwan. Amidst such a scenario, Gopalganj and Muzaffarpur showed expansion in gross cropped area at 0.51% and 1.65% respectively.\nVII.13 Shrinkage in gross cropped area was more widespread among the districts of the east alluvial plains with Munger showing a high rate of decline at (-)3.99% per annum. Bhagalpur, on the other hand, showed minimal shrinkage in gross cropped area at (-)0.09% per annum. Begusarai and Saharsa showed expansion in gross cropped area at 3.50% and 0.49% per annum respectively. Districts of the south-west alluvial plains also showed a decline in gross cropped area, although at modest rates ranging between (-)0.74% as in Aurangabad and 0.16% as in Patna. Nalanda was the lone district in this zone to show expansion in gross cropped area at 0.11% per annum. In contrast to the districts of the south-west alluvial plains, the districts of the plateau region showed a declining trend uniformly with the only exception of Dhanbad. It ranged between (-)5.53% as in Ranchi and (-)0.48% as in Hazaribagh.\n\nCHAPTER VII\nTREND AND PATTERN OF LAND USE - ZONE-WISE/DISTRICT-WISE ANALYSIS\nThe present chapter seeks to address the question of how the land use pattern has been changing over the years and how it varies across different agro-climatic zones/districts in Bihar. These questions assume significance in the context of output maximization on the one hand and constraints in the adaptation of modern technology on the other. This calls for the adoption of a land policy to ensure optimum use of land.\na) Land Use Pattern - An Aggregate Analysis\nVII.2 Despite vast geographical spread, the availability of agricultural land was relatively low in Bihar. It was 62.5% in the state as against 86.0% in Haryana, 86.7% in Punjab, 68.1% in Uttar Pradesh, and 66.5% in West Bengal. This was largely due to high forest area (17.0%) on the one hand and large non-agricultural land (18.1%) on the other. Net sown area was still low in Bihar at 45.40% as compared to states such as Haryana, Punjab, West Bengal, and Uttar Pradesh where it formed as high as 81.7%, 83.8%, 60.3%, and 58.1% respectively. In terms of per capita availability, the net sown area was low at 0.09 ha for Bihar as against 0.22 ha for Haryana, 0.21 ha for Punjab, and 0.12 ha for Uttar Pradesh. Again, the share of net sown area to total reporting area was found to be declining in Bihar over these years. It formed 49.38% in 1950-51, declined to 47.98% in 1980-81, and 45.40% in 1990-91. The rate of decline was (-)0.93% per annum during 1977-91. Part of the low net sown area could be seen in relatively high fallow land (10.42%), culturable waste (16.29%), and barren land (5.6%) in the state. At the all-India level, fallow land was only 7.36%, culturable waste was 4.95%, and barren land was 5.93%. In Punjab and Haryana, the share of fallow, waste, and barren land was relatively low at 4.50% and 6.60% respectively.\nVII.3 Barren land and cultivable waste land declined annually at (-)1.64% each in the state. However, fallow land, both permanent and current, showed an increasing trend at 0.74% and 0.80% respectively, ultimately leading to the shrinkage in net sown area in the State.\nVII.4 Comparing the land use pattern in Bihar with that at the all-\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BHAGALPUR<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar showing minimal shrinkage in gross cropped area at (-)0.09% per annum)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NALANDA<|>GEO<|>A district in the south-west alluvial plains of Bihar, showing an expansion in area sown more than once and a slight expansion in gross cropped area at 0.11% per annum)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAYA<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar, showing an increase in the range of area sown more than once at 1.29%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SANTHAL PARGANAS<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar experiencing a high rate of decline in area sown more than once at (-)9.22%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DHANBAD<|>GEO<|>A district in the plateau zone of Bihar, showing a decline in area sown more than once at (-)2.03% but an exception in the declining trend of gross cropped area in the plateau region)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SINGHBHUM<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar, showing an increasing trend in area sown more than once at 6.21%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAZARIBAGH<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar, showing an increasing trend in area sown more than once at 1.90% and a modest decline in gross cropped area at (-)0.48%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PALAMU<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar, showing an increasing trend in area sown more than once)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RANCHI<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar, showing an increasing trend in area sown more than once at 1.61% and the highest decline in gross cropped area in the plateau region at (-)5.53%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOPALGANJ<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar, showing expansion in gross cropped area at 0.51%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUZAFFARPUR<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar, showing expansion in gross cropped area at 1.65%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUNGER<|>GEO<|>A district in the east alluvial plains of Bihar, showing a high rate of decline in gross cropped area at (-)3.99% per annum)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEGUSARAI<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar, showing expansion in gross cropped area at 3.50% per annum)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAHARSA<|>GEO<|>A district in Bihar, showing expansion in gross cropped area at 0.49% per annum)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AURANGABAD<|>GEO<|>A district in the south-west alluvial plains of Bihar, showing a decline in gross cropped area at (-)0.74%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PATNA<|>GEO<|>The capital district of Bihar, showing a modest expansion in gross cropped area at 0.16%)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANTHAL PARGANAS<|>DHANBAD<|>Both districts are in the plateau zone of Bihar but show different trends in area sown more than once<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOPALGANJ<|>MUZAFFARPUR<|>Both districts showed an expansion in gross cropped area amidst a general declining trend in Bihar<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BEGUSARAI<|>SAHARSA<|>Both districts showed expansion in gross cropped area in the east alluvial plains of Bihar<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NALANDA<|>GAYA<|>Both districts in the south-west alluvial plains of Bihar showed an increase in the area sown more than once<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RANCHI<|>HAZARIBAGH<|>Both districts in the plateau region of Bihar showed an increasing trend in area sown more than once but different trends in gross cropped area<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
