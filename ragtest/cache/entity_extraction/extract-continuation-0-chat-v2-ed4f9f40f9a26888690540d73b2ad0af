A holistic system-based approach, is therefore, needed to simultaneously enhance productivity, profitability, equity, and environmental sustainability through synergistically integrating crop, horticulture, livestock, fisheries, agroforestry, watershed-based soil and water management, social capital formation, agro-processing, and marketing infrastructure.\n202. The core of the new strategy would be to address problems crop-wise and area-wise. The focus in the proposed strategy would be primarily two-fold: (i) how Bihar can emerge as the granary of India, and (ii) how Bihar can become a major hub for both national and international markets for horticultural products and fisheries. It is also realized that, in light of geophysical characteristics, there should be a distinct development strategy for flood-prone and drought-prone areas of Bihar.\nFollowing basic strategies and policy directions are proposed for agriculture and allied sectors.\nA. Strategy for Crop Husbandry\nAdoption of Crop-wise Strategy\n203. In order to emerge as the â€˜Granaryâ€™ of India, to provide balanced nutrition to the rising population, and to generate sufficient surplus for agro-based industries, a food grain production growth rate of 5-6% has to be attained in the next 10 years. The present level of food grain production of 119 lakh MT will increase to 195 lakh MT by the year 2015. Major part of the increase in food grain production will come from maize, rice, and pulses. Rice, pulses, and maize being the thrust crops, area-specific and crop-specific strategies will be adopted. Crop-wise strategies as proposed are as follows:\nStrategy for Rice:\n204. The state has about 3.2 million ha under rice cultivation, which is mostly rainfed, covering both uplands and shallow lowland ecosystems. The area has decreased from 3.66 to 3.22 million ha during the last six years. The state average productivity is about 1 tonne/ha. The Stateâ€™s average per hectare productivity potential is in the range of 5-6 tonnes. The major constraints in production are flash floods and submergence, drought in uplands, zinc deficiency, and bacterial blight. Appropriate technological interventions and strategies are:\n(i) Cultivation of short-duration and drought-tolerant varieties Vandana, Tulasi, Rajashree.\n(ii) Cultivation of varieties like ARRH 2, DRRH 2 in normal situations and Rajendra Mahsuri, Rajendra Sweta, and Swarna in flood-prone and submergence areas.\n(iii) Cultivation of bacterial blight-resistant varieties such as Ajaya, IR 64.\n(iv) Application of zinc sulphate in zinc-deficient areas.\n(v) Propagation of system of rice intensification (SRI) Technology.\n(vi) Propagation of hybrid varieties.\n(vii) Propagation of Boro rice in the non-rainy season as the productivity is very high due to the absence of disease, pests, and weeds, but it requires committed irrigation. Further, it should also be supported by a strong seed programme and fine/scented variety for raising income.\n(viii) Propagation of replacement of long-duration varieties with short and medium-duration varieties.\nStrategy for Wheat:\n205. Bihar is potentially an important wheat-growing state that contributes 5.7% towards national production from 8% of wheat-growing area of the country with a low productivity of 1.9 tonnes/ha. The yield gap between farmersâ€™ fields and frontline demonstration is about 1.2 tonnes/ha. The area, production, and productivity, averaged over the last five years, are 2.1 million ha, 4 million tonnes, and 1.9 tonnes/ha, respectively. The average per hectare productivity of wheat can be around 4-5 tonnes by adoption of technological means. Bihar possesses high potential for it in light of favorable geo-climatic and soil conditions. The major constraints in production are low seed replacement rates, late sowing, low farm mechanization, and foliar blight disease. Suitable technological interventions are:\n(i) Timely sowing and harvesting.\n(ii) Development of short and medium duration varieties.\n(iii) Site-specific nutrient management.\n(iv) Mechanization (Combine Harvesting & Zero Tillage Sowing).\n(v) Growing salinity/alkalinity tolerant varieties KRL 19 and KRL 1.78.\n(vi) Resource conservation technologies such as zero tillage, FIRBS, and laser land leveling.\n(vii) Use of improved varieties like:\nIrrigated timely sown: K 0307, HD 2824, HD 2733, HP 1761, PBW443, HUW 468, K9107, NW 1012.\nIrrigated late sown: DBW 14, NW 2036, HW 2045, NW 1014, HD 643, HP 1744.\nRainfed timely sown: K 8962, K 8027, MACS 6145, HD 2888.\nStrategy for Maize:\n206. Maize occupies 6.49 lakh ha with production of 13.60 lakh tonnes and productivity of 2.1 tonnes/ha. Winter maize is popular in Bihar due to its high yield potential, and the area, predominantly under hybrid cultivation, is on the increase. The productivity of winter maize decreased from 3,094 kg/ha in 2004-05 to 2,641 kg/ha in 2005-06. The low productivity is mainly\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India focusing on agricultural development to emerge as the granary of India and a major hub for horticultural products and fisheries, addressing both flood-prone and drought-prone areas with specific strategies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRANARY OF INDIA<|>EVENT<|>The goal for Bihar to significantly increase its food grain production to provide balanced nutrition and generate surplus for agro-based industries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A key crop in Bihar's agricultural strategy, with efforts to increase productivity through technological interventions and specific varieties suitable for the state's diverse ecosystems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHEAT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Another crucial crop for Bihar, with strategies to improve productivity through technological means and addressing constraints like low seed replacement rates and farm mechanization)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAIZE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A significant crop in Bihar's agricultural plan, especially winter maize, with strategies to increase area under hybrid cultivation and improve productivity)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>GRANARY OF INDIA<|>Bihar aims to transform into the Granary of India through increased food grain production and agricultural development<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>RICE<|>Bihar is implementing strategies to enhance rice production as part of its agricultural development plan<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>WHEAT<|>Bihar is focusing on wheat as a key crop to improve its agricultural productivity and contribute to its goal of becoming the Granary of India<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>MAIZE<|>Maize is identified as a crucial crop in Bihar's strategy to increase agricultural productivity and support its agro-based industries<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
