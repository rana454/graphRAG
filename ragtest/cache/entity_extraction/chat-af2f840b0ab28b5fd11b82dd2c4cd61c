Performance of the east alluvial plains was modest with a rate of increase in yield at 1.67%. For plateau districts, the rate of increase in yield was positive but marginal at 0.93% only.\nIV.1.20\nAnalysing the rate of growth in paddy yield separately for the two sub-periods, it is observed that the north-west alluvial plains showed an increasing trend at 2.36%, while all other zones showed a declining trend during the first sub-period. The rate of decline was as high as (-)5.24% in the zone of plateau districts, followed by (-)4.37% in the south-west alluvial plains. The rate of decline was relatively modest at (-)1.74% in the east alluvial plains. The second sub-period, however, witnessed a reversal to an increasing trend in growth rates in the yield of paddy in all the zones, ranging between 4.53% in the south-west plains and 2.60% in the plateau districts. The rate of increase was modest at 3.55% in east alluvial plains.\nIV.1.21\nAmong the districts, the rate of growth in yield of paddy was relatively high in less dominant paddy-growing districts. Such districts included Madhubani (4.61%), Saran (8.18%), and Siwan (4.12%) in the North-West; Bhagalpur (3.95%) and Munger (7.30%) in the East plains; Patna (5.55%) and Nawadah (10.29%) in the South-West plains; and Hazaribagh (5.96%) and Palamu (6.40%) in the plateau zone. In some of the dominant paddy-growing districts as well, the rate of growth in yield of paddy was high. They included Bhojpur (4.70%), Gaya (4.91%), and Nalanda (7.95%).\nSeasonality of Paddy Production\nIV.1.22\nArea, production, and yield of paddy in three different seasons, i.e., autumn, winter, and summer during 1977-91, were also analysed. It is observed (Table IV.1.3) that winter paddy dominated both in terms of production (88.05%) and area (85.03%) in 1990-91. Autumn paddy was next in importance with a 10.48% share in production and a 13.63% share in the area under paddy in 1990-91. Summer paddy constituted almost an insignificant proportion both in terms of area (1.34%) and production (1.47%). Production of paddy showed an increasing trend in all the seasons during 1977-91. However, the rate of increase was relatively high for autumn (4.08%) and summer (4.08%) paddy. Winter paddy grew at 1.92% per annum during the same period. The share of winter paddy production to total paddy production had a declining trend, albeit marginally, at (-)0.22%, whereas in respect of autumn (1.94%) and summer paddy production (0.95%) the share was increasing during the same period.\nIV.1.23\nAnalysing the area of paddy under different seasons, it is observed that the area of winter paddy showed a declining trend at (-)0.74% during 1977-91. On the other hand, the area of autumn and summer paddy showed an increasing trend at 1.37% and 1.05% respectively during the same period. In terms of yield, summer paddy showed a higher level (1364 kg/ha.), followed by winter paddy (1290 kg/ha.) in 1990-91. For autumn paddy, it was relatively less at 958 kg/ha. Over the years during 1977-91, the rate of increase in yield was again higher for summer paddy (3.03%), followed by autumn paddy (2.71%). For winter paddy, the yield also showed an increasing trend, albeit relatively less at 2.67%.\nRegional Pattern\nIV.1.24\nAnalysing the pattern across different zones/districts, it is observed that more than one-third (36.37%) of winter paddy was produced in the south-west plains, with the plateau contributing around one-fourth (24.45%) of the total winter paddy production in the State. In the case of autumn paddy, it was the north-west which produced around two-thirds (62.73%) of the output. Other zones showed negligible presence of autumn paddy cultivation. In summer paddy, the east plains dominated in production. The zone had a share of almost three-fourths (71.60%) in the State's summer paddy production. Analysis of the district-wise pattern suggests that districts such as Gopalganj (12.83%), East Champaran (11.01%), and West Champaran (9.97%) in the north-west; Ranchi (12.07%) in the plateau; and Purnea (8.65%) in the east plains figured prominently in autumn paddy production. In summer paddy production, districts of Katihar (42.46%), Purnea (20.52%), and Saharsa (6.83%) in the east plains; and West Champaran (8.80%) in the north-west plains dominated.\na) Production\nIV.1.25\nProduction of winter paddy showed an increasing trend in the north-west\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
