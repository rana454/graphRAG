However, their performance has been less than expected, with a mismatch between deposit mobilization and advances.\nvi) Regional Distribution: District-wise analysis showed that agriculturally prosperous zones/districts received relatively more credit. Credit per hectare was higher in areas with high food grains production.\nvii) Regional Bias: Regional biases in credit flow were minimal, with the plateau zone receiving a similar level of share in total credit flow compared to other zones. The plateau zone even had a higher per hectare credit flow than the north-west and east plains.\nviii) Recovery Issues: The problem of high overdues has been severe in Bihar. Recovery levels were below 5.0% for PACS and under 20.0% for SLDB in recent years. While commercial banks showed relatively better recovery performance, it was still not encouraging.\n\nCHAPTER XII: OPERATIONAL HOLDINGS AND TENANCY STATUS\nThe present chapter attempts to understand broad features of operational holdings as well as tenancy status in the State. It also examines the adverse influence of these factors on the status of agriculture in the State. Analysis is based on secondary data available from the census of agriculture and other published sources.\n\nXII.1 Operational Holdings\nXII.2 Distribution and Size of Operational Holdings\nAnalysis of the distribution of operational holdings by size class of farmers at different points of time shows that the marginal and small farmers, with their combined share at 86.75% in 1980-81, dominated in the State. The numerical presence of such categories of farmers was much higher in Bihar compared to the national average of 76.23%.\nThe numerical strength of marginal farmers increased rapidly from 48.74 lakh in 1970-71 to 85.12 lakh in 1980-81, while the increase for small and semi-medium farmers was marginal. Medium and large farmers, on the other hand, showed a sharp decline in their numerical strength.\nCompared to the national average, the increase in the numerical strength of marginal farmers and the decline of medium and large farmers was more pronounced in Bihar.\nXII.3 Size and Increase in Operational Holdings\nThere were 117.1 lakh operational holdings with an area of 102.4 lakh hectares in the State in 1985-86. The average size of operational holding was only 0.87 ha. The average size of operational holding in Bihar was much smaller compared to states such as Haryana (2.75 ha.), Punjab (3.76 ha.), Andhra Pradesh (1.72 ha.), and Orissa (1.47 ha.). The all-India average was 1.57 ha.\nThe number of operational holdings increased from 75.8 lakh in 1970-71 to 117.1 lakh in 1985-86, a rise of 54.56%. This increase was higher in Bihar compared to the national level (48.24%) during this period. Bihar's increase was second only to Andhra Pradesh (71.22%).\nDespite the increase, the size of operational holdings declined in Bihar, showing a -10.85% decline, compared to increases in most other states. This decline was attributed to decreasing net sown area and increasing current fallow and barren land.\nXII.4 Size of Marginal Farmers' Holdings\nThe average size of operational holdings for marginal farmers in Bihar was 0.35 ha., less than the national average of 0.39 ha. in 1980-81. The average size for this category of farmers did not reduce significantly over the years. The small size of holdings raises concerns about viability, leading to phenomena such as reverse leasing, where marginal farmers lease out land to larger farmers.\nXII.5 Regional Pattern in Operational Holdings\nAnalysis of operational holdings across different zones/districts reveals significant skewness. Districts like Purnea, Muzaffarpur, and Gaya had large numbers of operational holdings, while districts like Katihar and Nawadah had fewer. The number of operational holdings did not consistently correlate with population density or the number of households.\nNotable increases in operational holdings were observed in districts such as Muzaffarpur (154.05%), Purnea (86.42%), Gopalganj (140.07%), Sitamarhi (84.08%), and Palamu (71.45%). However, Nawadah experienced a decline (-4.45%), while other districts such as Aurangabad, Singhbhum, Samastipur, Munger, Saharsa, Katihar, and Ranchi showed relatively less increase, attributed to partial implementation of land consolidation.\nXII.6 Shrinkage in Operated Area\nIn many districts, the operated area showed a shrinkage. Significant declines were recorded in Nawadah (-35.71%), Madhubani (-20.67%), Samastipur (-21.24%), Munger (-28.43%), and Saharsa (-39.85%). In districts with increased operated area, the rise was marginal. The combined effect of increasing operational holdings and decreasing operated area led to a decline in the average size of holdings across districts.\nXII.7 Surplus Land\nLand concentration issues are severe in Bihar, with 11.63% of the area owned and operated by just 0.64% large farmers.
