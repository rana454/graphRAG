Wheat is the main rabi crop in Bihar, and productivity levels have increased in the last five years. However, the levels remain below average for India and the WIGP.\nYield Disparities and Contributing Factors\nViewed from the district level, the differences in cereal yields between the Western and Eastern IGP appear more nuanced. Data from the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) indicate that rice yields are highest in Punjab and Haryana at 3.8 tons/ha and 2.7 tons/ha, respectively. In comparison, rice and wheat yields in Bihar fall below 2.7 tons/ha and 2.4 tons/ha, respectively, in most districts.\nYields are a function of several factors, including climate, investment in rural infrastructure, and the availability of various inputs of production. A recent analysis of Bihar’s agricultural sector examines the contribution of different sources—area, prices, diversification, and yields—to crop output growth for Bihar for the period 2001–2017.\nAddressing Constraints for Yield Improvement\nThe researchers found that the role of yields was an important determinant of growth in output, especially for staples like rice and wheat. However, for improvements in yields to translate into increased incomes, the report identifies two binding constraints that need to be addressed:\nEnsuring Stability in Crop Yields: Factors like weather, technologies, and the occurrence of pests and diseases play a crucial role in yield stability.\nEnsuring Adequate Price Realization and Market Linkages: Effective market linkages are essential to maximize income from increased yields.\nNext, we discuss each of these constraints, first at the state level, and then at the district level, for rice and wheat.\nImportance of Irrigation for Yield Stability\nA sustained increase in crop yields in Bihar will depend on inputs of production, like irrigation, mechanization, and the use of fertilizers. The availability of, and access to, adequate and timely irrigation is an important issue. Farmers need to have access to the right amount of irrigation at the right time for yield improvements to be realized. At 70 percent, the irrigated area cultivated for food grains is lower in Bihar than the nearly 100 percent coverage in Punjab and Haryana. The share of gross cropped area in the state that is irrigated has increased from 67.45 percent in 2011–12 to 72 percent as of 2017–18.\nTube wells are the largest source of irrigation in each agroclimatic zone in Bihar and covered 63 percent of the total gross irrigated area in the entire state as of 2018. The high share of tube wells is associated with overexploitation of groundwater resources and an associated decline in the water table. A lack of adequate power is a major constraint in expanding the area under groundwater irrigation.\nClimate and Its Impact on Crop Yield \nThe importance of irrigation for yield stability is, in large part, because of the rainfed nature of crop cultivation in Bihar. Climate plays a big role in determining crop yields in the state. Even though the state is endowed with fertile soils and abundant water, extreme weather patterns have adverse impacts on the stability of yields of rainfed crops like rice and wheat. The erratic nature of rainfall is reflected in the occurrence of droughts in the eastern parts of the state and floods in the northern districts. Crop yields are also constrained by the ineffective use of rainwater, lack of rainwater harvesting, and inefficient use of irrigation water.\nAddressing these issues requires investments in irrigation infrastructure, including flood and watershed management.\nUse of Inputs and Their Impact on Yields\nThe availability and use of other inputs, like fertilizers, pesticides, and seeds, also determine crop yields. The use of fertilizers in Bihar is high, at 201 kg/ha in 2018–19, with seasonal variations of 224 kg/ha in rabi and 177 kg/ha in kharif. Nearly half of the total fertilizer used is urea. However, the disproportionate use of nitrogenous fertilizers (N), relative to phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), has contributed to imbalanced nutrient use and associated deficiencies in the availability of micronutrients in the soil. Fertilizer policies should be reoriented to correct such an imbalance and support the achievement of increased yields in a sustainable manner.\nSeed Quality and Adoption\nCrop yields are also a function of the quality of seeds. The adoption of high-yield varieties of rice and wheat seeds was higher in the Western IGP than in the Eastern IGP, contributing in part to low productivity in the east.\nIn Bihar, seed replacement rates for paddy and wheat are below 50 percent, in contrast to those for maize, which are close to 90 percent. Pulses, too, are characterized by a low seed replacement rate.\n\nDistrict-Level Variations in Crop Yields\nThere is considerable district-level variation in the yields of staples and pulses within Bihar. These variations can be understood in terms of underlying differences in factors such as climate, irrigation infrastructure, and availability of inputs in each of the four agroclimatic zones. Next, we discuss the yield potential and constraints to growth for rice and wheat at the district level.\n\nRice Yield Variations Across Districts\nRice is the main kharif crop and is cultivated across all districts in Bihar. Rice yields are highest in the southwestern districts, exceeding 2,500 kg/ha in Rohtas, Arwal, Aurangabad, Kaimur, and Bhojpur. Conversely, the lowest rice yields are observed in the northwest and southeast zones of the state.\nThese differences are primarily a function of climate and irrigation facilities. The southwest zone\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIHAR<|>GEO<|>A state in India experiencing lower than average yields for rice and wheat compared to the rest of the country and the Western Indo-Gangetic Plains (WIGP))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WIGP<|>GEO<|>Western Indo-Gangetic Plains, a region with higher rice yields compared to Bihar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERNATIONAL CROPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR THE SEMI-ARID TROPICS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An institute that provides data on cereal yields across different regions, indicating disparities between Bihar and other areas like Punjab and Haryana)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUNJAB<|>GEO<|>A state in India with high rice yields, as indicated by ICRISAT data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARYANA<|>GEO<|>A state in India with significant rice yields, showcasing the agricultural disparities within the country)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>WIGP<|>Bihar has lower rice and wheat yields compared to the Western Indo-Gangetic Plains<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIHAR<|>INTERNATIONAL CROPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR THE SEMI-ARID TROPICS<|>ICRISAT provides data highlighting the yield disparities in Bihar<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUNJAB<|>INTERNATIONAL CROPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR THE SEMI-ARID TROPICS<|>ICRISAT data shows Punjab having high rice yields<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARYANA<|>INTERNATIONAL CROPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR THE SEMI-ARID TROPICS<|>ICRISAT data indicates Haryana as a high-yield state for rice<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
