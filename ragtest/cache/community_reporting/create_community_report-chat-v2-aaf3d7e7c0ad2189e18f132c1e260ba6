This authority, after consultation with the Central Insecticides Board, amends the Insecticides Rules and is responsible for the enforcement of the Insecticides Act, 1968, issuing notifications related to it. It oversees the regulation of insecticide manufacturing and use, handling appeals against decisions of the Registration Committee, and is involved in the process of granting licenses for manufacturing and selling insecticides.\n\nIn the realm of fertilizers, the Central Government is tasked with granting permission for their use for industrial purposes, setting standards, regulating distribution, and fixing prices to ensure equitable distribution and availability at fair prices. It oversees fertilizer allocation and can intervene in cases of suspension, cancellation, or debarment affecting the allocation. This government body specifies standards for fertilizers, including their manufacture, import, sale, and distribution, and sets requirements for packing and marking. It approves laboratories notified by the State Government for fertilizer analysis and regulates the packaging, sale, and standards of fertilizers. This includes the authorization of bulk sales directly to farmers, the disposal of non-standard fertilizers, imposing restrictions on the use of fertilizers for non-agricultural purposes, and mandating compliance with certain requirements for laboratory facilities by manufacturers.\n\nFurthermore, the Central Government is the authority behind the enactment of the Seeds (Amendment) Act, 1972, establishing the Central Seed Certification Board. It refers matters to the Committee, approves its bye-laws and procedures, and may constitute the Central Fertiliser Committee to advise on matters related to fertilizers. Additionally, it provides recommendations for the grant of Certificate of Registration for Sale of Fertiliser for Industrial Purpose, showcasing its comprehensive involvement in the regulation and oversight of agricultural inputs to ensure safety, quality, and fairness in the agricultural sector of India.\",34\n686,MANUFACTURER,\"The manufacturer in question is an entity engaged in the production of fertilizers, playing a crucial role in both industrial and agricultural sectors. This manufacturer is exempt from submitting Form O for dealership applications, indicating a streamlined process for them to distribute their products. Despite this exemption, they are allowed to sell fertilizers for industrial and agricultural use, provided they hold a valid certificate, ensuring that their operations meet specific regulatory standards.\n\nFurthermore, the fertilizers produced by this manufacturer are subject to price control and distribution regulations enforced by the Central Government. This implies that while the manufacturer has some leeway in how they conduct their business, they must adhere to strict guidelines regarding the pricing and distribution of their products to ensure fairness and accessibility in the market.\n\nIn addition to price and distribution controls, the manufacturer is required to comply with the Central Government's regulations concerning the quality and standards of fertilizers. This includes possessing minimum laboratory facilities, which are likely necessary for testing and ensuring that their fertilizers meet the mandated quality benchmarks. The regulations also permit the manufacturer to sell fertilizers in bulk under certain conditions, which could offer flexibility in how they approach sales and distribution strategies.\n\nOverall, the manufacturer operates within a regulatory framework that balances operational freedom with strict quality, pricing, and distribution controls. This ensures that while they can innovate and serve the needs of their industrial and agricultural clients, they must also contribute to the market's overall fairness and the well-being of the end consumers.\",5\n685,WHOLESALE DEALER,\"Dealer who sells fertilisers in bulk, not in retail, for agricultural use\",4\n1344,CENTRAL INSECTICIDES BOARD,\"The Central Insecticides Board is a pivotal authority tasked with advising the Central Government on a broad spectrum of issues related to insecticides.
