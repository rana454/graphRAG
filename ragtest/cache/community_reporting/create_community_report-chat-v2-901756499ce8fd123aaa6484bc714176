This region, encompassing districts such as Bhojpur, Patna, Rohtas, and Nawadah, has experienced various shifts in crop cultivation and irrigation practices over recent periods. Despite experiencing the highest rate of decline in the area under maize cultivation, the South-West Plains still contribute substantially to the state's wheat production. Interestingly, this region has seen a reversal from a decline to an increase in the area under potato cultivation, indicating a dynamic response to agricultural demands or practices.\n\nThe South-West Plains hold the distinction of having the highest share of gram area in the state, although it has shown a reversal to a declining trend in gram production, moving from an increase at a rate of 0.49% during the first sub-period to a decrease at -0.56% in the second sub-period. This suggests a fluctuation in gram production efficiency or possibly changes in market or environmental conditions affecting gram cultivation.\n\nIrrigation practices in the region have shown improvement, with an increasing trend in both canal and tubewell irrigation. This is particularly notable in districts like Nawadah, which have shown significant growth in irrigation infrastructure, potentially enhancing agricultural productivity and crop diversity.\n\nAdditionally, the South-West Plains have a considerable area under chilli cultivation. However, similar to maize, this crop has shown a declining trend in both sub-periods, which might reflect challenges such as climatic conditions, market access, or other agronomic factors affecting chilli production.\n\nIn summary, the South-West Plains of Bihar are characterized by their substantial contributions to wheat production, dynamic shifts in potato and gram cultivation areas, and evolving irrigation practices. Despite facing declines in maize and chilli cultivation areas, the region's agricultural landscape is marked by its adaptability and significant role in the state's overall agricultural output.\",12\n83,SUGARCANE,\"Sugarcane is a significant cash and commercial crop in Bihar, playing a crucial role in the state's agricultural economy. It is not only a source of sugar and other products but also a key component of Bihar's agricultural production. The crop covers an area of 1.43 lakh hectares in Bihar, with an estimated output of 12.33 lakh metric tons. Despite facing productivity issues similar to those of rice and wheat, sugarcane is an integral part of the agricultural diversification in the state, indicating potential for further diversification and involvement in high-tech agricultural projects. Over the years, sugarcane has seen a notable increase in its share of the gross cropped area, particularly during the second sub-period, marking a turnaround from a declining trend to an increasing trend.\n\nNationally, sugarcane is a major crop in India, with productivity rates varying across different states. In Bihar, it ranks 10th among sugarcane-producing states, showing increased production and productivity over the years. This crop is predominantly grown in the North-West and is considered a major non-foodgrain crop due to its large cultivation area. Overall, sugarcane's significance in Bihar and across India underscores its importance as a commercial crop with a substantial impact on the agricultural economy.\",5\n1812,RAPSEED/MUSTARD,\"Rapeseed/Mustard crops are integral to the agricultural diversification observed in certain areas of Bihar, showcasing a shift towards varied types of agricultural production. These crops are particularly significant as a major non-food crop, with their prominence more noticeable in the East Plains and North-West Plains.
