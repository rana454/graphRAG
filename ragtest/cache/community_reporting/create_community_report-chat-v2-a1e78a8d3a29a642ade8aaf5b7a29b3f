It has become a significant cash crop in the region, contributing to agricultural growth with an increasing acreage over time. Despite some fluctuations, maize has seen a notable increase in production, largely due to rising productivity and the introduction of high-yielding varieties (HYVs), including the successful adoption of winter maize. This crop has achieved a remarkable 100% seed replacement rate in Bihar, surpassing the national average, which indicates advancements in agricultural practices from 2003-04 to 2021-22.\n\nThe cultivation of maize in Bihar spans both the kharif and rabi seasons, with the crop facing challenges such as waterlogging and floods. However, it shows high yield potential, especially in the winter season, when conditions are more favorable. The area under maize cultivation experienced some stagnation and decline initially, but there has been some recovery, particularly with the push towards increasing the area under hybrid cultivation and improving overall productivity. This effort is part of Bihar's agricultural plan, which emphasizes the importance of winter maize and strategies to enhance its cultivation.\n\nMaize production in Bihar has seen significant growth, with a high growth rate in yield, especially noted during the second sub-period, peaking at 5.14%. This growth is attributed to the crop's versatility and increasing importance, known for its high productivity and commercial profitability in various forms, such as baby corn and sweet corn. Despite a slight decline in the physical area dedicated to maize, there has been an increase in HYV coverage, reflecting changing agricultural practices aimed at boosting yield.\n\nThe crop has faced fluctuations in yield and market prices, yet it remains a vital part of Bihar's economy. The state has seen a significant increase in maize yield over the years, despite a decline in area, with notable growth rates and comparisons with national averages and other states. This success story is partly due to the cultivation of maize in both the kharif and rabi seasons, with yields below its potential but showing better performance in winter maize. Overall, maize stands as a significant crop in Bihar's agricultural landscape, with a history of growth and regional cultivation patterns detailed from 1971 to 1993, indicating a long-term trend of increasing importance and productivity.\",33\n325,POULTRY,\"The poultry sector in Bihar encompasses poultry farms and hatcheries that have demonstrated significant growth in meat production. This sector is experiencing a rising demand, especially for maize, which indicates its growth and potential impact on the state's economy.
