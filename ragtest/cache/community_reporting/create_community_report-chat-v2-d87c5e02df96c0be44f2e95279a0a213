These crops, which include major types such as rapeseed, mustard, and linseed, cover only a small portion of the gross cropped area in the region. Despite this, they are an important part of Bihar's agricultural focus, with Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) conducting demonstrations to improve cultivation practices among farmers. Initially, oilseeds experienced an expansion in the area under cultivation, but this growth faced stagnation during a subsequent period. The general trend for these crops, which also encompass nigerseed, has shown varying shifts in the area dedicated to their cultivation. Overall, oilseeds in Bihar are characterized by their stable production levels, minor contribution to the total cropped area, and the efforts to enhance their cultivation through agricultural extension activities.\",6\n1162,KVKS OF BIHAR,\"Krishi Vigyan Kendras in Bihar, responsible for organizing training programs for farmers, farm women, rural youth, and extension functionaries to promote agricultural development\",4\n1880,LINSEED,\"Linseed, an oilseed crop, experienced a reversal in its cultivation area, losing ground during the second sub-period.

Despite this setback, Nigerseed showed a growth response of 1.81% during the period from 1971 to 1993, although there was a slight decrease in growth during the second sub-period.
