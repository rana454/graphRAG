This department plays a crucial role in facilitating the development of export-enabling infrastructures and coordinates support for the implementation of Price Support Schemes for the procurement of commodities. It is deeply involved in imparting training to farmers on modern crop production technologies, thereby transforming nutritional outcomes, particularly in Bihar. This transformation is partly achieved through its involvement in the production side of agriculture.\n\nMoreover, the Department of Agriculture oversees various agricultural programs, including the training and quality testing of agricultural machinery. It recognizes the importance of collaboration, notably with the Department of Health, to address food safety risks and crop cultivation issues effectively. In Bihar, it supports Jeevika groups in diversifying farming systems towards nutrition-rich crops, underlining its commitment to improving nutritional outcomes through agriculture.\n\nThe department is also at the forefront of implementing the Agricultural Mechanization Scheme in Bihar. This scheme provides subsidies on agricultural machines and manages the Online Farm Mechanization Application Software (OFMAS), demonstrating the department's dedication to modernizing agriculture through technology. Additionally, it is responsible for the implementation of the Agriculture Roadmap, which encompasses the development of government agricultural market yards, promotion of agricultural exports, and strengthening of the farmer producer organization ecosystem in Bihar.\n\nTraining initiatives extend to nurturing identified groups/Farmer Producer Companies (FPCs) for nursery operations and promoting tissue culture among other agricultural advancements. This comprehensive approach underscores the Department of Agriculture's multifaceted role in not only overseeing agricultural programs but also in driving forward the sector's development and ensuring the welfare of the farming community.\",24\n221,GOVERNMENT OF INDIA,\"The Government of India plays a pivotal role in the country's agricultural, environmental, and industrial sectors through a variety of policies, schemes, and initiatives aimed at development and disaster management. It provides benefits and incentives under various policies and schemes to promote agricultural development, including offering a minimum support price (MSP) to farmers to incentivize agricultural production. This ensures that farmers receive a guaranteed price for their crops, encouraging them to produce more. Additionally, the government has set targets for the production of key staples like rice, wheat, and pulses under the XI Plan, supporting these efforts with funds for high-quality seeds, fertilizers, and demonstration projects to boost agricultural output.\n\nRecognizing the importance of disaster mitigation and preparedness, the Government of India has invested in strategies such as Early Warning Systems to manage the risk of natural disasters, particularly in vulnerable states like Bihar. This reflects its commitment to safeguarding its citizens and their livelihoods against unforeseen natural calamities.\n\nAs the central authority, the Government of India is involved in the creation of policies and orders that have far-reaching impacts on various sectors of the economy. One such policy is the Fertiliser (Control) Order, 1985, which underscores its role in regulating the agricultural inputs critical for farming. Furthermore, it is responsible for granting industrial dealership for the sale of Urea and regulating the import and use of fertilizers in the country, ensuring that agricultural practices are sustainable and environmentally friendly.\n\nIn addition to its focus on agriculture, the federal government has initiated policies like the National Rural Drinking Water Program and the Jal Jeevan Mission to ensure the provision of safe drinking water to its rural population. These initiatives highlight the government's commitment to improving the quality of life for its citizens by addressing fundamental needs such as access to clean water.\n\nOverall, the Government of India's multifaceted approach to governance encompasses the promotion of agricultural development, disaster risk management, and the improvement of living standards through the provision of essential services. Its policies and schemes are designed to support economic growth, environmental sustainability, and the well-being of its population, reflecting its role as a central authority dedicated to the nation's progress and resilience.\",18\n437,FARMER PRODUCER ORGANIZATIONS (FPOS),\"Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) are community institutions in Bihar that have been given preferential treatment in the allotment of assets in market yards, with the primary aim of supporting small and marginal farmers.

This initiative is part of a broader effort to enhance income gains from yield improvements and to promote sustainable agricultural development. FPOs play a crucial role in aggregating farmers to link them to markets, thereby enhancing income gains through better market linkages. They enable farmers to benefit from economies of scale, collective bargaining, and access to markets, credit, inputs, and technology.
