This district, situated in the plateau zone, plays a significant role in the agricultural sector, contributing notably to the production of various crops. Ranchi is a major contributor to potato, paddy, and arhar production, with a particular emphasis on autumn paddy, where it boasts a share of 12.07%. It has the highest area under paddy cultivation as mentioned in the text, highlighting its pivotal role in the region's agriculture.\n\nThe district has shown an impressive increase in maize yield and has an area dedicated to chilli cultivation, indicating a diverse agricultural output. Despite facing challenges such as a high rate of decline in gross cropped area at (-)5.53% and shrinkage in the level of irrigation, Ranchi has demonstrated resilience. The decrease in irrigation levels between 1977-91 was the least among its peers, showing a decrease of only 0.77%. This resilience is further evidenced by an increasing trend in the area sown more than once, at 1.61%, and an increase in crop intensity, suggesting efficient use of available agricultural land.\n\nRanchi has also experienced a significant rate of decline in net sown area, yet it has managed to maintain a high share of miscellaneous crops in its gross irrigated area. The district is notable for its significant growth rate in the area under potato cultivation and has a high credit flow in the plateau zone, which may support its agricultural activities.\n\nThe district is home to Shri Radhakant Giri, a successful farmer in bee-keeping, and hosts the Divyayan Krishi Vigyan Kendra, indicating a strong presence of agricultural innovation and education. This blend of traditional and innovative farming practices underscores Ranchi's importance in the agricultural landscape of the region.\n\nIn summary, Ranchi, while facing certain agricultural challenges, stands out for its diverse crop production, including significant contributions to potato, paddy, and arhar production. Its efforts in increasing crop intensity and maintaining a varied agricultural output, alongside hosting notable agricultural figures and institutions, mark it as a key player in the agricultural sector of the plateau region of India.\",12\n1230,DHANBAD,\"Dhanbad, a district situated in the plateau zone of Bihar, India, is characterized by its diverse agricultural practices and challenges. It is involved in Niger cultivation and has shown increased agricultural productivity, indicating a focus on agricultural development. However, the district faces several agricultural challenges, including a decline in the area sown with paddy across seasons, which reflects a broader trend of decreasing agricultural activity in certain crops. Despite this, Dhanbad has a high coverage of High Yielding Variety (HYV) wheat, suggesting a significant adoption of improved agricultural technologies for wheat cultivation. Yet, it ranks as the district with the least fertilizer consumption in the plateau zone of Bihar, which could indicate minimal agricultural activity or a reliance on more sustainable farming practices.\n\nDhanbad has experienced a notable decline in the area sown more than once, with a decrease of 2.03%, but it stands as an exception in the plateau region with its declining trend of gross cropped area. This suggests that while the district is facing challenges in increasing its agricultural output, it is managing to maintain a relatively stable gross cropped area compared to other districts in the region. The district has also seen a significant shrinkage in irrigation levels between 1977-91, with a decrease of 12.15%, which has likely impacted its agricultural productivity, particularly in water-intensive crops like paddy.\n\nThe district's summer paddy yield is on a declining trend, further emphasizing the challenges faced in water management and crop production. Despite having a high percentage of HYV wheat area, Dhanbad is experiencing a sharp decline in HYV area for other crops, indicating a potential shift in cropping patterns or challenges in maintaining HYV crop areas. The district shows a high rate of decline in current fallow land and an increasing trend in area under barren land, which could reflect changes in land use or the abandonment of less productive agricultural land.\n\nAdditionally, Dhanbad has a high share of miscellaneous crops in its gross irrigated area, suggesting a diversification in cropping patterns, possibly as a response to the challenges faced in traditional crop production. The district also exhibits higher instability in wheat production, which could be attributed to varying climatic conditions, irrigation challenges, or other agronomic factors affecting wheat yields.\n\nIn summary, Dhanbad is a district that showcases both the potential and challenges of agriculture in the plateau zone of Bihar. While it has made strides in adopting improved agricultural technologies and diversifying its crop production, it faces significant hurdles in irrigation\",7\n1860,PLATEAU ZONE,\"The Plateau Zone, a region in Bihar, has been experiencing a variety of agricultural trends. This region saw a slowdown in growth and a declining trend in the area under potato cultivation, indicating a shift in agricultural practices or productivity. It is also characterized by much lower fertilizer consumption, with an average of only 25.66 kg per hectare, which is significantly lower than other regions. This could be a contributing factor to its agricultural performance.\n\nIn terms of cereal production, the Plateau Zone has the lowest share of wheat production and the lowest maize yield in Bihar. However, it is noteworthy that there has been growth in maize yield over time, suggesting improvements in agricultural techniques or conditions. Despite these challenges, the region exhibits mixed trends in paddy production, with some districts experiencing increases while others face declines. This variability indicates a complex interplay of factors affecting paddy cultivation across the Plateau Zone.\n\nFurthermore, the Plateau Zone has the least area under chilli cultivation, and this area is experiencing shrinkage. This decline in chilli cultivation area could be due to a variety of factors, including changing climate conditions, shifts in farmer preferences, or economic challenges.\n\nOverall, the Plateau Zone presents a mixed picture of agricultural productivity, with certain crops showing declining trends in cultivation area and others experiencing growth in yield. The low fertilizer consumption and the specific challenges faced by crops like wheat, maize, paddy, and chilli highlight the need for targeted interventions to support agricultural development in this region of Bihar.\",7\n1244,IINRG,\"Indian Institute of Natural Resins and Gums, Ranchi, where training on scientific lac cultivation practices is imparted\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\n537,BIHAR,RANCHI,\"Ranchi, a district situated in the plateau zone of Bihar, plays a significant role in the state's agriculture, notably in the production of potatoes, arhar (pigeon pea), and paddy.
