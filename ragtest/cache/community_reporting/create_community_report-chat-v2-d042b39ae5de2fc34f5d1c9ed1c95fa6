This region, demarcated by the Ganges, features a plain topography with drainage submerging into the river Ganges, making it prone to flooding. The area is affected by recurrent floods due to its river systems originating in Tibet and Nepal. These floods have a significant impact on agriculture, yet the extensive flood plains and wetlands support major fisheries resources, which are targeted for scientific development.\n\nNorth Bihar's economy is heavily reliant on agriculture, and the region is making efforts to promote Khus cultivation in the Diara areas of Budhi Gandak and Kosi rivers. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to mitigate the effects of flooding and to take advantage of the region's fertile lands. Despite the challenges posed by frequent floods, North Bihar remains an important agricultural hub, with plans to leverage its natural resources and agrarian base for future development.\",12\n3,SOUTH BIHAR,\"South Bihar is a region characterized by a unique blend of agricultural and industrial activities, situated in the southern part of the state. It is largely recognized for its plain topography, where drainage from the plateau region merges into the Ganges, contributing significantly to the state's agriculture. Despite its agricultural potential, South Bihar faces considerable challenges due to its drought-prone nature, with around 40 percent of the area affected by water shortages. This contrasts sharply with the flood-prone conditions of North Bihar.\n\nThe region's agro-climatic conditions are distinct, necessitating need-based planning in agriculture to address its specific challenges. Efforts are focused on increasing agricultural land, improving water levels, and preventing soil erosion to enhance agricultural practices and productivity. Despite the prevalent drought conditions, there has been a notable increase in groundwater levels, attributed to the activities outlined in the Fourth Agriculture Road Map. This strategic plan promotes the cultivation of aromatic and medicinal plants using micro-irrigation and distillation unit facilities, aiming to mitigate the impact of drought and improve the livelihoods of the local population.\n\nSouth Bihar's river systems, primarily originating from Indian territories, play a crucial role in the region's agriculture, although the area continues to grapple with the contrasting issues of water shortages and the need for efficient water management. The region's focus on improving agricultural practices through innovative and sustainable methods highlights the ongoing efforts to overcome its environmental challenges and enhance its economic development.\",8\n46,GANGA,\"The Ganga is a major river flowing through Bihar, effectively dividing the state into North and South regions.
