This district is experiencing a high rate of decline in the area sown more than once, recorded at -9.22%, indicating a reduction in multiple cropping practices. Despite this, Santhal Parganas has shown a significant rate of growth in arhar yield at 9.82%, making it a notable contributor to gram production in the region. It is also recognized for its contribution to the state's food grains production, with a particular emphasis on paddy and sugarcane yields.\n\nThe district has seen an increase in the area under summer paddy cultivation, which aligns with its reputation for having a high area under paddy cultivation overall. This makes it a significant contributor to paddy production in the plateau region of Bihar. However, there has been a prominent decline in canal irrigation by -9.35%, which has been mentioned twice, indicating challenges in irrigation practices that might affect agricultural productivity.\n\nSanthal Parganas is also mentioned for its cultivation of gram and rapeseed/mustard, alongside a range of potato yields. Despite its achievements in certain crops, the district has relatively low levels of arhar yield compared to its gram production, where it is considered a major growing district. The district's agricultural profile is further characterized by its use of High Yielding Variety (HYV) seeds, though the coverage is on the lower side, suggesting room for improvement in seed technology adoption.\n\nThe district's position in the plateau zone of India is associated with a notable decline in crop intensity and a decrease in canal irrigation, which could impact its long-term agricultural sustainability. Additionally, it has been recognized for its notable credit flow, which could indicate financial activities supporting its agricultural sector.\n\nIn summary, Santhal Parganas is a district in Bihar, situated in the plateau zone, facing challenges in irrigation and crop intensity but making significant contributions to the state's agriculture, especially in paddy, gram, and sugarcane production. Its agricultural dynamics are marked by both achievements in yield growth for certain crops and areas for improvement in irrigation practices and seed technology adoption.\",8\n1862,PLATEAU,\"The Plateau region, encompassing areas such as Hazaribagh, Palamu, and Santhal Parganas, is undergoing significant changes in its agricultural practices and land use.

Alongside these changes in irrigation practices, there is a declining trend in crop intensity across the Plateau, indicating a decrease in the intensive use of land for cultivation. Despite these shifts, the Plateau contributes 10.37% of the maize production, although maize holds less prominence in the region's overall cultivation pattern.
