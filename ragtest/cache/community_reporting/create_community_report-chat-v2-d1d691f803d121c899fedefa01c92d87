The economic status of Bihar is often contrasted with that of Jharkhand, particularly in terms of per capita income, highlighting the differences in economic development between the two states. Geographically, Bihar's landscape underwent significant changes after the bifurcation that led to the creation of Jharkhand, with 8.0 million hectares of land being allocated to the new state. This division has positioned Jharkhand to the south of Bihar, while conversely, Bihar is located to the north of Jharkhand. This geographical relationship underscores the close yet distinct connection between the two states, both in terms of their physical proximity and their economic contrasts.\",646\n145,BIHAR,GOVERNMENT OF INDIA,\"Farmers in Bihar are facing challenges in fully benefiting from the Minimum Support Price (MSP) provided by the Government of India, primarily due to a weak marketing infrastructure in the state. Despite these challenges, the Government of India is actively supporting Bihar through the implementation of disaster mitigation and preparedness strategies. These strategies are designed to manage agricultural risks and natural disasters, aiming to safeguard the livelihoods of farmers and the agricultural sector in Bihar. This dual approach highlights the government's commitment to enhancing the agricultural framework in Bihar, addressing both the immediate issue of marketing infrastructure and the long-term resilience against natural calamities.\",644\n48,BIHAR,WHEAT,\"Bihar is strategically focusing on wheat as a key crop to enhance its agricultural productivity, aiming to fulfill its ambition of becoming the Granary of India. The state's current agricultural policy places a significant emphasis on wheat cultivation, although there are suggestions that diversifying crops could improve nutritional outcomes. To boost wheat productivity, Bihar is increasing the seed replacement rate and adopting better agricultural practices. Farmers in the state prefer cultivating wheat over pulses due to its lower risk, underlining wheat's pivotal role in Bihar's agricultural landscape.\n\nWheat stands as a major crop in Bihar, reflecting both the state's agricultural practices and the challenges it faces in terms of productivity. Despite being a staple food crop and the key rabi crop, discussions around wheat production in Bihar often touch upon issues of productivity. The cultivation of wheat has seen substantial growth and its distribution spans across the state, yet it faces challenges similar to those of rice, such as erratic rainfall and price fluctuations. Although the area under wheat cultivation has remained largely unchanged, the yield has seen a decline. When compared with other states, wheat's average productivity in Bihar is a topic of analysis, and while its yield growth was notable, it was less than that of maize and ragi.\n\nThis comprehensive view of wheat in Bihar showcases the state's efforts to improve agricultural output through focused policies and practices. However, it also highlights the need for addressing productivity challenges and considering crop diversification to enhance nutritional outcomes and agricultural sustainability.\",643\n518,BIHAR,HYV SEEDS,\"Bihar's agricultural sector is experiencing a transformation with the increasing use of High Yielding Variety (HYV) seeds as a significant measure of modern agricultural input. This expansion in the use of HYV seeds in Bihar highlights the state's focus on maximizing agricultural output through the adoption of improved seed varieties. However, the inadequate use and availability of HYV seeds also underline a critical need for further development and promotion of seed varieties that are suitable for Bihar's specific conditions. This suggests a dual narrative of progress and challenge within Bihar's agricultural practices, where the adoption of modern technologies like HYV seeds is seen as a path to enhanced productivity, yet the full potential of these technologies is still to be realized due to existing constraints on their use and availability.\",643\n367,BIHAR,ROHTAS,\"Rohtas, a district in Bihar, is renowned for its diverse agricultural practices and significant contributions to the state's foodgrains production. It is particularly known for its chilli production, which, despite showing instability and a high coefficient of variation, remains a major agricultural activity. Rohtas also stands out for its high rice yields, which are among the highest compared to other districts within Bihar. The district's agricultural landscape is marked by relatively high irrigation intensity, reflecting advanced agricultural practices and a significant increase in irrigation, although there has been a noted shrinkage in tubewell irrigation.\n\nIn addition to chillies and rice, Rohtas has a diversified agricultural base that includes significant cultivation of gram, making it a key district for gram production in Bihar. It is also a leading district in paddy production and a prominent district for wheat production, with a high proportion of the state's total wheat area located within its boundaries. The district's high HYV (High Yielding Variety) coverage in wheat production further underscores its role in bolstering Bihar's food security.\n\nDespite its agricultural successes, Rohtas has faced challenges, including a deceleration in growth rates and an increasing trend in the area under barren land. However, it continues to exhibit growth rates above the state average, highlighting its resilience and importance within Bihar's agricultural sector. The district is also involved in potato production, adding to its agricultural diversity.\n\nIn summary, Rohtas is a significant district in south-west Bihar, known for its advanced agricultural practices and substantial contributions to the state's foodgrains production, including major outputs in chilli, rice, gram, paddy, and wheat. Its agricultural landscape is characterized by high irrigation intensity, a wide variety of crops, and challenges that include instability in chilli production and an increase in barren land.\",642\n108,BIHAR,DARBHANGA,\"Darbhanga, a district located in the north-west plains of Bihar, plays a significant role in the state's agricultural sector, contributing notably to the high yield levels of jute in Bihar's non-traditional growing areas.
