It stands out as a dominant chilli-growing district, not only maintaining but also showing an increasing trend in chilli production, which is a notable exception among its peers. Besides chillies, Vaishali has made its mark in the production of jute, particularly achieving high yield levels in areas not traditionally known for jute cultivation. The district is also recognized for its tobacco cultivation, with both the area under cultivation and production volumes on the rise, making it a major tobacco-growing district in Bihar.\n\nIn addition to these cash crops, Vaishali is known for its cultivation of fruits and vegetables, contributing to the diversity of its agricultural output. However, the district faces challenges in achieving high yields of paddy, a staple food grain, which is reflected in its contribution of less than 2.0% to Bihar's total state foodgrains production. Despite these challenges, Vaishali has shown high growth rates in yield for certain crops and maintains moderately high crop intensity, indicating a robust agricultural sector.\n\nThe district has also seen an increasing trend in the area under barren land, which poses a challenge to agricultural productivity. Nonetheless, Vaishali's considerable fertilizer consumption suggests efforts to enhance agricultural productivity and mitigate the impact of increasing barren land.\n\nVaishali's agricultural sector is further diversified with activities such as beekeeping, highlighting its role as one of the main regions in Bihar for this industry. Despite a noted deceleration in growth rates in some areas, the district's overall agricultural scene is marked by resilience and adaptability. The combination of increasing production trends in key crops, like chillies and tobacco, alongside efforts to boost yields and crop intensity, underscores Vaishali's significant contribution to Bihar's agricultural landscape.\",635\n838,MAIZE,SAMASTIPUR,\"Samastipur is recognized as a major district contributing significantly to maize production, boasting the highest maize yield among the districts analyzed.
