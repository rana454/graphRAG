This state has been highlighted as an exemplary model for rainwater harvesting practices, which support its horticulture despite the challenges posed by low rainfall. Rajasthan's agricultural achievements also extend to wheat yields, indicating a diverse agricultural sector.\n\nHowever, the state faces challenges in its gram production sector. Despite being a major gram-producing state with a high production of 827.90 thousand tonnes during 1990-93 and occupying a significant cultivation area of 1376.80 thousand hectares in the same period, there has been a noticeable decline in gram production and a shrinkage in the area under gram cultivation. This decline contrasts with its past status when it had a large area dedicated to gram cultivation.\n\nMoreover, Rajasthan's performance in gram yield levels has been compared unfavorably with Bihar, showing a declining trend. Despite these challenges, Rajasthan maintains a high area under rapeseed/mustard cultivation, significantly surpassing Bihar in this regard.
