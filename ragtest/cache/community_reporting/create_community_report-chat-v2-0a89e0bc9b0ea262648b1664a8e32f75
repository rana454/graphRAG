This legislative change was aimed at deregulating the agricultural market, which was previously controlled by the APMC Act. The repeal was intended to foster a more competitive and efficient agricultural market by eliminating the monopoly of government-regulated market yards and allowing farmers to sell their produce directly to buyers. The necessity to create alternative market structures following the repeal indicates a significant shift towards a more liberalized agricultural market, aiming to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of agricultural marketing in the region.
