It is situated in the south-west alluvial plains, specifically in the South Bihar Alluvial Plains, and is part of Zone-III in Bihar. This district has managed to achieve a high percentage of irrigated area, thanks to a significant increase in canal irrigation by 4.52%, and has shown resilience with a high growth rate in gram production at 4.39%. Aurangabad is notable for its high pulse production and productivity, with a significant area under pulse cultivation, and has also seen impressive yields in rice and potatoes. The district has experienced a growth in rapeseed/mustard production during 1977-91 and has maintained a high share of credit to agriculture.\n\nDespite these achievements, Aurangabad faces challenges such as a decline in gross cropped area at (-)0.74%, a shrinking trend in autumn paddy production, and a decrease in tubewell irrigation. The area under barren land is on the rise, and there has been less increase in operational holdings, which could be attributed to partial land consolidation. However, the district has seen significant changes in paddy area across seasons and an increase in crop intensity, indicating a dynamic response to agricultural demands.\n\nThe district is also a site for innovative farming ventures, supported by Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) Aurangabad, where individuals like Abhishek Kumar, Amresh Singh, and Satyendra Kumar are conducting their farming and crop diversification ventures. Additionally, Aurangabad has benefited from soil and water conservation schemes, reflecting its strategic importance in Bihar's agricultural sector.\n\nOverall, Aurangabad presents a complex but promising picture of agricultural development, marked by both achievements and challenges. Its strategic initiatives in irrigation, crop production, and conservation efforts highlight its potential as a key agricultural district in Bihar.\",11\n1854,SOUTH-WEST ALLUVIAL PLAINS,\"The South-West Alluvial Plains, a region in Bihar, India, is characterized by its agricultural dynamics and challenges. This region has experienced a minor decline in rapeseed/mustard production during the first sub-period, with unspecified changes in the second sub-period. Despite this, it has shown a high growth rate in wheat production, with a large area dedicated to wheat cultivation, indicating its significant role in the agricultural sector of Bihar. However, the region is facing a decline in net sown area, partly due to the expansion of other waste land and barren land, which poses a challenge to its agricultural productivity.\n\nIn terms of crop intensity, the districts within the South-West Alluvial Plains mostly exhibit an increasing trend, suggesting that intensive cultivation practices are being adopted to enhance agricultural output. This is further evidenced by the notable paddy yield in the region, which, despite experiencing a decline in the first sub-period, has managed to recover in the second. This resilience underscores the region's significant role in paddy production, which has shown both increasing and declining trends over time.\n\nAdditionally, the region has seen a relatively stable rate of decline in chilli production across both sub-periods, indicating a need for strategies to reverse this trend and bolster chilli production. Overall, the South-West Alluvial Plains represent a region with diverse agricultural practices and challenges, including fluctuating production trends in key crops such as rapeseed/mustard, wheat, paddy, and chilli, alongside efforts to increase crop intensity and combat the reduction in net sown area.\",5\n1856,WINTER PADDY,\"Paddy production during the winter season, dominating in terms of production and area in 1990-91\",2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\n369,BIHAR,AURANGABAD,\"Aurangabad, a district in Bihar, plays a significant role in the state's agriculture, contributing notably to both paddy and rice production, which underscores its capabilities in cultivating staple crops. The district is also known for its high pulse and significant potato production, particularly in the south-west plains, highlighting its diverse agricultural output. Furthermore, Aurangabad has shown a high growth rate in gram production, positioning it as a key contributor to the state's legume supply.\n\nThe district's agricultural expansion is supported by increased canal irrigation, although there has been a noted shrinkage in tubewell irrigation. Despite this, the overall growth rates in agriculture and related sectors are above the state average, indicating a robust and expanding agricultural sector. However, there is an increasing trend in the area under barren land, which could pose challenges to future agricultural productivity.\n\nIn summary, Aurangabad district in Bihar is a vital agricultural hub with a diverse crop production portfolio, including paddy, rice, pulses, and potatoes, supported by both canal and, to a lesser extent, tubewell irrigation.
