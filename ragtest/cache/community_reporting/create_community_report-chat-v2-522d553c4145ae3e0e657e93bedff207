It is recognized for its importance with Bihar receiving the Krishi Karman Award in 2011-12 for outstanding rice production and productivity. As a key component of Bihar's agricultural strategy, there have been concerted efforts to enhance rice productivity through technological interventions and the introduction of specific varieties tailored to the state's diverse ecosystems. Despite these efforts, rice production in Bihar has faced challenges, including a decline in both production and the area under cultivation, and an average yield that is significantly lower than its production potential. This is attributed to various factors, including lower productivity than the national average despite high private investment and a yield growth rate of only 1.30% per annum, which is the lowest among the crops grown in the state.\n\nTo address these challenges and improve yield, Direct Seeded Rice by Zero Tillage has been adopted as a method for resource conservation and to increase yield, marking it as a major kharif crop in the region. However, rice remains one of the major crops in Bihar with lower productivity than desired, highlighting the need for continued efforts in technological and methodological advancements to meet its production potential. The crop's significance is not only in its contribution to the state's agricultural output but also as a primary kharif crop, integral to Bihar's cropping pattern.\",6\n341,KRISHI KARMAN AWARDS,,4\n230,MAIZE PRODUCTION,\"Maize production in Bihar is a significant agricultural activity, noted for its high yield per hectare and its substantial role in the state's economy.

This strategic focus on maize cultivation has positioned Bihar as the third largest producer of maize in India.
