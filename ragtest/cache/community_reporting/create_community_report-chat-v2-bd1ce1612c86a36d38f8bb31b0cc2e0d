Despite being crops that Bihar specializes in, with productivity greater than the All-India average, pulses have remained stagnant in productivity during this period. This stagnation is attributed to a lack of promising and pest-disease-resistant varieties, which has been a significant concern for local farmers. Additionally, there has been a moderate fall in both production and acreage of pulses in the state, further exacerbated by a negative trend rate of growth annually in the area dedicated to these crops. Despite these challenges, pulses are suggested as an alternative agricultural focus to diversify Bihar's production systems and improve nutritional outcomes. Strategies have been proposed to enhance the productivity of pulses, aiming to address the current issues and leverage Bihar's specialization in these crops to achieve better results in the future.\",5\n96,GRAM,\"Gram, a pulse crop, is notable for its significant contribution to the agricultural diversity and potential of Bihar, marking it as a key element in the state's productivity. Despite facing a declining trend in the area cultivated across consecutive sub-periods, Gram has demonstrated resilience with a yield increase rate of 2.13% during the same timeframe. This data underscores its identification as a major crop based on available data and its agricultural importance. The juxtaposition of its declining cultivation area with its increasing yield highlights the challenges and successes in Gram cultivation, reflecting its critical role in the agricultural landscape.\",2\n249,URAD,\"URAD is a type of pulse that has demonstrated a significant growth trend in cultivation area during the period of 1971 to 1993, alongside other pulses such as masoor and khesari.
