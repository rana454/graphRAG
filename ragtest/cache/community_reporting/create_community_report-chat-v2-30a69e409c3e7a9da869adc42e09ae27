Despite facing drought conditions, Munger has a higher percentage of irrigated area than the state average, thanks to an increase in canal irrigation by 2.89%. This district is part of the South Bihar Alluvial Plains, specifically in Zone-III, and is known for its significant agricultural activities, including a notable presence in the east alluvial plains.\n\nThe district has seen a variety of trends in its agricultural sector. There has been a high growth rate in yield, particularly for paddy and wheat, with paddy output experiencing a relatively high growth rate and wheat yield also showing impressive growth. Munger has achieved a better yield of paddy and has been recognized for its increase in paddy yield, especially in the winter season, despite a declining trend in autumn paddy production and a notable decline in summer paddy area. Furthermore, the district has shown a significant rate of increase in gram production at 6.76%, highlighting its high share of gram production and making it a key area for pulse cultivation. Sugarcane yield has also seen impressive growth rates during the second sub-period.\n\nHowever, Munger faces several challenges, including a declining trend in the gross cropped area at (-)3.99% per annum, low crop intensity at 123%, and a declining trend in area sown more than once. The district has experienced a shrinkage in tubewell irrigation and a notable shrinkage in operated area, alongside a significant rate of decline in net sown area and high fertilizer consumption. Additionally, there has been a declining trend in tobacco yield in both sub-periods and a declining trend in output of food crops.\n\nThe TARINA program is active in Munger, focusing on agricultural and nutritional improvements. This initiative, along with efforts by TCI-TARINA, has been working to empower women's self-help groups and conduct research on women's empowerment in agriculture. These efforts are part of broader soil and water conservation schemes implemented in the district, which is one of the 18 districts in the state targeted under the state plan for such works.\n\nDespite the overall declining trend in the east alluvial plains, Munger has shown resilience by increasing its yield, demonstrating the district's potential for agricultural productivity and sustainability.

Despite experiencing a declining trend in gram production, with a decrease of -1.19% and low fluctuation, Bhagalpur remains a major gram-growing district, contributing 5.37% to the production. The district has shown a reversal from declining trends to increasing trends in both tobacco and jute production during the study periods analyzed. Specifically, tobacco yield has seen a positive turnaround, and there has been an increasing trend in jute production in both sub-periods examined.\n\nIn terms of irrigation and crop intensity, Bhagalpur has experienced an increase in canal irrigation by 2.08%, which is significant for the district's agricultural development. However, the district exhibits relatively low crop intensity at 122%, indicating room for improvement in this area. The stagnant fertilizer consumption suggests potential issues in agricultural development, with an excessive share of nitrogen in fertilizer use being a particular concern.\n\nBhagalpur is also noted for its achievements in other agricultural sectors. It has shown impressive growth rates in sugarcane yield during the second sub-period and has made notable gains in paddy area, including autumn and winter paddy production. The district has a relatively better yield of paddy and has seen a notable increase in summer paddy yield. Despite being prone to drought with low rice yields, Bhagalpur has managed to maintain minimal shrinkage in gross cropped area at (-)0.09% per annum.\n\nThe district falls under Zone-III in the South Bihar Alluvial Plains and is part of the East Alluvial Plains, where it has shown modest increases in foodgrains production at 3.48%.
