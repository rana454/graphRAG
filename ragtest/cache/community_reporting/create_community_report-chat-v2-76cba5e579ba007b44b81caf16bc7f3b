It is notably flood-prone, which significantly affects its agricultural output, yet it has managed to develop advanced agricultural practices, as evidenced by its high irrigation intensity. This district is renowned for its dominant share in jute production and is considered a major jute-producing district within the state, contributing significantly to Bihar's overall jute output. Besides jute, Katihar is known for growing a variety of fruits and vegetables, and it has a notable presence in the cultivation of rapeseed/mustard, summer paddy, and maize, with impressive increases in maize yield reported.\n\nDespite being a low wheat producer, Katihar has seen a significant expansion in the area under high-yielding variety (HYV) wheat, although it faces higher instability in wheat production. The district's agricultural activity is further reflected in its high fertilizer consumption and the high share of credit allocated to agriculture. Crop intensity in Katihar is remarkably high at 161%, indicating a dense agricultural practice, which includes a significant involvement in both autumn and summer paddy production. However, it has experienced varying trends in paddy production, including a decline in yield despite an increase in the area under summer paddy cultivation.\n\nKatihar's agricultural landscape is also marked by less skewness in the distribution of land and fewer operational holdings compared to other districts. It has one of the least coverages of irrigation at 29.54%, a factor that might contribute to the challenges faced in maximizing agricultural output. The district has shown a positive turn in food grains production growth and has been part of an increasing trend in crop intensity, which is a testament to its resilience and adaptability in the face of environmental and infrastructural challenges.\n\nThe district is part of the East Alluvial Plains, specifically included in Zone-II of Bihar, and is known for its contribution to the production of chilli, arhar, and tobacco, although it has experienced a slackening growth in jute area and a reversal from an increasing to a declining trend in tobacco yield. Despite these challenges, Katihar has shown a high rate of growth in chilli yield during 1977-91 and has been identified as a less dominant potato-growing district with a high growth rate in this crop.\n\nKatihar's role in Bihar's agriculture is not limited to crop production; it is also one of the main regions where beekeeping is practiced, indicating a diverse agricultural and\",12\n1853,EAST ALLUVIAL PLAINS,\"The East Alluvial Plains, a region in Bihar, India, has experienced varied agricultural trends across different crop productions over recent periods. Initially, this region observed a reversal in the trend of rapeseed/mustard production, moving from a decline in the first sub-period to an increase in the second sub-period. However, it has faced a negative growth rate in tobacco production alongside a declining yield trend, indicating challenges in this crop sector. Similarly, chilli production in the East Alluvial Plains saw an initial increase before experiencing a significant decline in rates during the second sub-period.\n\nIn contrast, wheat production in the region has been on the rise, supported by a considerable area dedicated to wheat cultivation, showcasing the region's strength in this agricultural sector. Despite facing a general decline in gram production at a rate of -2.26%, the region has seen a modest increase in paddy yield at 1.67%. This increase came after a modest decline in the first sub-period, followed by an improvement in the second, suggesting a recovery in paddy cultivation. The trends in paddy production across the region's districts have been mixed, with some districts experiencing increases and others seeing declines. However, most districts within the East Alluvial Plains have shown an increasing trend in crop intensity for cultivation, indicating a positive move towards more intensive farming practices.\n\nThe region's performance in foodgrains production varies significantly among its districts, with some surpassing the state average growth rates. This variability highlights the diverse agricultural dynamics within the East Alluvial Plains. Additionally, the region's trends in land use align with those observed in other parts of India, although specific details were not provided. Overall, the East Alluvial Plains exhibit a complex agricultural landscape, with certain crops thriving and others facing challenges, reflecting a mix of increasing and declining production trends across different agricultural sectors.\",10\n141,PURNIA,\"Purnia, a district located in the North East Alluvial Plains of Bihar, is recognized for its vulnerability to floods as well as its agricultural prowess. It stands out for excelling in the production of specific crops, such as maize and wheat, and has shown a significant potential for diversification and involvement in high-tech agricultural projects. The district is particularly noted for its high maize production and has seen an expansion in the area under High Yielding Varieties (HYV), alongside a notable increase in fertilizer consumption, which indicates a strong focus on agricultural development. This development is further evidenced by the increasing trend in maize HYV area and significant irrigation intensity, despite having one of the least coverage of irrigation in the state at 23.87%.\n\nPurnia falls under Zone-II in the east plains of Bihar and has been identified for its relatively higher increase in paddy yield and notable gains in summer paddy area. The district has also been recognized for its food grains production, with a high growth rate observed in the second sub-period. It has a considerable area under chilli cultivation and has shown acceleration in increasing growth rates of chilli production, with Purnia having a significant share in chilli production at 6.05%. Additionally, the district has high HYV seed coverage for paddy and has made significant strides in wheat production, largely due to area expansion, holding a notable proportion of the total wheat area in the state.\n\nIn terms of cash crops, Purnia has a significant tobacco growth rate of 4.51%, although it experienced a reversal from an increasing trend to a declining trend in tobacco yield. The district also showed a high rate of growth in chilli yield during 1977-91, indicating its capacity for successful crop yield improvement over time. Despite these advancements, Purnia is one of the districts experiencing minimal change in total factor productivity over three decades. However, it is also one of the districts in the zone showing growth rates exceeding 5.0% during the period, highlighting its agricultural development potential amidst challenges.\",8\n1142,MAHANANDA,\"The Mahananda is a river that originates in Nepal and enters Bihar, where it becomes a significant part of the state's river network. It drains into the Ganga, contributing to the extensive network of rivers in Bihar. The Mahananda is known for its contribution to the flood problems in the state, posing challenges during the rainy season. Additionally, it is recognized as part of the ground water resource evaluation's sub-basins in Bihar, indicating its importance in the region's water resource management and planning. This river plays a crucial role in the hydrological and ecological dynamics of Bihar, impacting both its natural environment and the lives of the people residing near its banks.\",2\n1857,SUMMER PADDY,\"Paddy production during the summer season, with an almost insignificant proportion in terms of area and production in 1990-91\",4\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\n78,BIHAR,KATIHAR,\"Katihar, a district within the state of Bihar, is renowned for its advanced agricultural practices, highlighted by its high irrigation intensity.
