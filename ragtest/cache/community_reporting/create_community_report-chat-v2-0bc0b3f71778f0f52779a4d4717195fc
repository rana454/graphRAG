It provides benefits and incentives under various policies and schemes to promote agricultural development, including offering a minimum support price (MSP) to farmers to incentivize agricultural production. This ensures that farmers receive a guaranteed price for their crops, encouraging them to produce more. Additionally, the government has set targets for the production of key staples like rice, wheat, and pulses under the XI Plan, supporting these efforts with funds for high-quality seeds, fertilizers, and demonstration projects to boost agricultural output.\n\nRecognizing the importance of disaster mitigation and preparedness, the Government of India has invested in strategies such as Early Warning Systems to manage the risk of natural disasters, particularly in vulnerable states like Bihar. This reflects its commitment to safeguarding its citizens and their livelihoods against unforeseen natural calamities.\n\nAs the central authority, the Government of India is involved in the creation of policies and orders that have far-reaching impacts on various sectors of the economy. One such policy is the Fertiliser (Control) Order, 1985, which underscores its role in regulating the agricultural inputs critical for farming. Furthermore, it is responsible for granting industrial dealership for the sale of Urea and regulating the import and use of fertilizers in the country, ensuring that agricultural practices are sustainable and environmentally friendly.\n\nIn addition to its focus on agriculture, the federal government has initiated policies like the National Rural Drinking Water Program and the Jal Jeevan Mission to ensure the provision of safe drinking water to its rural population. These initiatives highlight the government's commitment to improving the quality of life for its citizens by addressing fundamental needs such as access to clean water.\n\nOverall, the Government of India's multifaceted approach to governance encompasses the promotion of agricultural development, disaster risk management, and the improvement of living standards through the provision of essential services.
